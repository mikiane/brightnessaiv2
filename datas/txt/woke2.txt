                cultural pluralism; the American system in particular gives people the

                This applies both to politics, in the form of federalism, and to the most

                society, while still true in some ways, is also to a large extent outdated.
                This chapter makes the case that civil rights law, out of all the problems
                one can focus on, should be an area of concern for those interested in

                human progress. In broad terms, modern civil rights law has at least
                four major effects on American society: the war on merit, restrictions

                creative destruction in personnel management, and widespread social
                strife as reflected in our culture wars.
                   How could one area of law have such disastrous downstream effects
                in so many different areas of life? By way of analogy, this question can be

                answered by noting that one might be skeptical of a claim that there is a
                                         lin


                medicine that cures a large number of ailments, while being more ready
                to believe that there is a poison with a large number of negative health
                effects. Like the human body, society is an extremely complex system,
                                ol



                which means that there are many more potentially harmful interven-
                tions than there are beneficial ones. Civil rights law has effectively
                    rC




                ended freedom of association as the default assumption in American
                private life, and it reaches down to regulate nearly all forms of interper-
        pe




                sonal relations. There is no reason to expect the downstream effects of
                such a revolutionary change to be constrained to one area of human ex-
                istence. One cannot make a comprehensive list of all the things that can
ar




                go wrong in a centrally planned economy, because the theory the system
                being analyzed relies upon fundamentally contradicts sound economic
H




                principles. Likewise, the idea that the federal government can regulate
                personal relationships is so contrary to human nature, and reflects such
                a misunderstanding of the organic ways in which cultures and norms de-
                velop, that it should be unsurprising to learn that the post-1964 regime
                has had dire and wide-­reaching consequences.

                   Similarly, the belief that in a world free of discrimination every
                group would have equal outcomes in every field is—­and this is not an
                exaggeration—­contrary to everything one would learn from the most
                cursory study of human history.1 As Steven Farron points out, minority
                groups have often done socioeconomically well in the face of extreme

                societal discrimination.2 Some examples include the Chinese in South-
                east Asia and the Jews in Eastern Europe. The reason for this is that




                                                                          he
                under most circumstances, people are too selfish for discrimination to
                play a major role in relative socioeconomic outcomes.
                   Bigots, like other people, care more about their own personal comfort

                and financial interests than they do about hurting others. This is true
                even under the most extreme circumstances.3 A Nazi Party report from

                1937 complained that “large parts of the population, and even of the

                Party community, do not bother . . . even about the most basic demand,
                namely not to buy from the Jew.”4 The political leadership in the Third
                Reich was not immune to this desire for needed goods and services at
                reasonable prices, as Hitler himself decorated the Berghof with drap-

                sumption without going to war against important principles such as

                While large socioeconomic disparities that are not based in underlying
ar




                differences in productivity cannot exist in a market system, government
                is of course a different story, and here widespread discrimination can

                need for government is accepted, the question becomes what kind of
                criteria to use to select state employees. For most of recorded history,
                nepotism and patronage were the standard methods.5 Powerful men
                would distribute state offices to their family members or officials who

                would then owe them favors. In the American context, patronage took
                the form of the “spoils system” that emerged in the nineteenth century
                and became the target of progressive reformers. Government employ-
                ees were appointed and removed based on loyalty to elected officials,
                were frequently given paid leave to campaign for them, and might even

                campaign had entitled him to a diplomatic post in Paris. As a result,
                Congress finally decided that change was needed, and in January 1883, it
                passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. The bill authorized the

                   The president was given discretion to decide which federal employ-

                government covered went from 11 percent shortly after the bill was
                signed to 46 percent by 1900.9 Yet the impact of the new merit system
                was even stronger than those numbers would indicate, since it tended
ar




                to disproportionately cover the most important government officials.10
                This greatly increased American state capacity. In 1895, Theodore Roo-

                ery Cabinet officer whom I have seen in Washington has, before the
                end of his term, come to the conclusion that if there was any bureau
                in which he needed special efficiency, he had to put it under the civil
                service law.”11

                    Modern science has generally confirmed the belief of nineteenth-­
                century reformers that standardized tests can predict employee perfor-
                mance. The superiority of standardized tests as a method of selection
                cannot be completely credited to the scientific accomplishments of psy-
                chometricians in designing such useful tools; it is less the case that writ-

                everything else is so much worse. Personality tests, for example, rely

                on self-­assessment, and there is no guarantee that a candidate will have
                a high degree of self-­awareness or even answer honestly. Standardized
                exams that try to measure general intellectual ability, in contrast, do not

                if the candidate can figure out what the right answers are. Interviews

                factors tend to limit their predictive ability.
                    In the empirical literature, there is no question that intelligence tests
                are, in general terms, the best predictors of job performance, regardless

                methods that would do precisely that. The difficulty created by civil
                rights law is so well known that it is referred to as the “validity-­diversity
                    rC




                trade-­off ”: the better a metric is for predicting job performance, the
                larger its disparate impact.13 Nineteenth-­century progressives did not
        pe




                have access to modern social science, but they were on the right track
                when they argued that objective standards provided a better basis for
                hiring than subjective processes or arbitrary characteristics.

                conclusively settled in favor of merit. Yet this consensus would not sur-

                    Despite the move toward race-­consciousness in the decade after the
                passage of the Civil Rights Act, old ideas about merit still had a foothold

                out guidelines that explicitly stated that getting employers to switch to
                                ol



                tests that rejected whites and non-­whites at more equal rates was a goal
                of public policy.16 This was opposed by the CSC, and even the precursor
                    rC




                to the OFCCP tended to think that the EEOC was going too far in its
                hostility to merit-­based standards.

                    The USCCR, which advises the rest of the government on civil rights
                issues, sympathized with the EEOC position. In a 1970 report, it noted
                that the examination process was the main method for selecting fed-
ar




                eral employees. Out of 2.5 million applicants a year, 300,000 to 450,000
                would be hired after being screened through tests.17 The USCCR criti-
H




                cized the exams for having an “impersonal, formal, authoritarian” as-
                pect. Reflecting the view of the civil rights establishment of the time,
                it celebrated the fact that some tests used for federal employment had
                dropped arithmetic and algebra in the name of achieving equality.
                    In 1972, Congress created the Equal Employment Opportunity

                wanted, or whether to take a “bottom-­line” approach that only looked at
                final results and therefore could preserve a larger role for written tests,

                released a report noting that EEOC regulations were so confusing that
                employers were dropping tests altogether and adopting hiring quotas to
                protect themselves. Showing the attitudes of the civil rights community,

                sibility that one could theoretically exist at some point in the future.21
                   In the end, the question of merit versus representation that had been
        pe




                waged within the federal bureaucracy was settled by an election. In 1976,
                Jimmy Carter won the presidency, and his administration came down
                on the side of the EEOC and the civil rights lobby.22 With overwhelming

                preeminent civil rights enforcement agency in the federal government.
                The Civil Service Commission was abolished as a standalone entity and
                split up into the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Per-
                sonnel Management (OPM).

                    At the risk of oversimplification, we may divide American governance
                into four eras. From the Founding to the presidency of Andrew Jack-
                son, there was the era of elite rule. Then came the spoils system, which
                was ended, albeit imperfectly, with the Pendleton Civil Service Reform
                Act of 1883 and the formation of the Civil Service Commission. The era




                                                                                        rs
                of meritocratic hiring lasted just under a century. Since 1978, when the
                Civil Service Commission was abolished, if not earlier, we have been




                                                                         he
                living in the racial spoils era, where government maintains impersonal
                standards but seeks to distribute jobs across various official categories.
                    With the CSC on its way out, the EEOC was able to finally get its




                                                                       is
                way on federal hiring. In Luévano v. Campbell, a group of civil rights law-
                yers filed a lawsuit against OPM, the main successor to the CSC, on the




                                                                bl

                (PACE) discriminated against blacks and Hispanics under Title VII.23
                The Carter Justice Department was sympathetic to the plaintiffs. It
                therefore agreed to settle in January 1981, just as Reagan was coming
                into office, and PACE was eliminated. This was after the Nixon adminis-

                ter Luévano, according to the Washington Post, as of 2015, in most kinds
                of federal hiring, “applicants who make it past the initial screening do
                so based on résumés, self-­assessments and a measure of luck.”24 While
                                ol



                reforms have been attempted, the federal government has not been able
                to solve the validity-­diversity trade-­off any more than private employers
                    rC




                have.
                    Interestingly, one way to potentially get around the problem is
        pe




                through explicit quotas. In the first decades of the EEOC’s war on test-
                ing, employers had begun to “race-­norm” exams, which simply meant
                giving extra points to individual blacks and Hispanics by only compar-
ar




                ing their scores to those of the same ethnic group. With that method,
                instead of eliminating standards, one can at least find the most qualified
H




                people from each race. The EEOC was in favor of this practice as a means
                to achieve equal representation, at one point actually prosecuting a Ten-
                nessee company for not giving extra points to black applicants.25 When
                race-­norming became the subject of public controversy, however, it
                caused an outcry, and the practice ended up being banned in the Civil

                Rights Act of 1991.26 In one of the many ironies of civil rights law, a con-
                servative political victory actually ensured less merit and competence
                in hiring, since the alternative to explicit quotas has always tended to
                be a shift toward eliminating objective standards altogether. The EEOC,
                generally opposed to merit when it makes demographic balance more

                   Written exams are far from the only standard targeted by civil rights

                   While the war on merit has gone furthest in the public sector, it has

                however, a key difference between the public and private sectors is that

                those that used testing planned to cut back, and 14 percent were going

                in 2022 asked applicants to include an IQ score, a New York University
                School of Law professor recommended that “to avoid legal risk, com-
                panies shouldn’t rely on these tests. They should just be talking to job

                inatory process should find little difference between groups selected for
                the same position.31 The diversity-­validity trade-­off exists everywhere,
                but in the private sector, it actually is a trade-­off, while government
                                ol



                agencies do not need to be competent to continue to maintain their

                    rC




                sector is forced to use tools of questionable legality since the disparate
                impact standard makes practically everything legally questionable. At
        pe




                the same time, it protects itself from legal liability and maintains access
                to government contractors through the use of soft quotas. This is sim-
                ilar to the “diversity” justification used to practice affirmative action in
ar

                no such thing. Government, in contrast to business, generally puts legal
                liability rather than performance front and center, and hence settles the
                trade-­off between merit and civil rights decisively in favor of the latter.
                    Just as employers are forced to pursue diversity indirectly, they are
                forced to pursue competence indirectly. Generally, more abstract IQ

                for choosing, managing, and promoting personnel. There is no need to
                make such decisions on behalf of the private sector, however. Moreover,

                profits and ultimately GDP, people have preferences regarding how they
                spend their time, and they may well look for various qualities in choos-

                of living in a free society is the ability that individuals have to opt in to or
                out of various kinds of cultures, and this goes beyond racial and religious

                communities. People have different preferences regarding whether they

                   A workplace is simply another area of life where individuals form

                a community. The same arguments for letting people choose how to

                lief that individuals know best how to manage their own lives—­apply

                that we should allow more freedom in how individuals arrange their

                forty activities studied, work came in second-­to-­last place in how happy
                it made individuals, ahead of only “sick in bed.” For most people, work is
                a source of misery, perhaps by some measures the main source of misery

                    In the name of equality between groups, civil rights law has sought to
                “depersonalize” the American workplace. Yet research indicates that it
                      rC




                is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. Government should
                not declare a moratorium on the “pursuit of happiness” for forty hours
        pe




                a week. Civil rights law is not like safety, environmental, or health reg-
                ulations.
                    Most world religions do not have a straightforward view of the mini-

                Private clubs, even when of a secular nature, often engage in gender seg-

                    Economists differentiate between two kinds of discrimination. First




                                                                         he
                is statistical discrimination: someone judges individuals based on group
                characteristics. For example, if a business is looking to hire someone
                who must be trusted to count money, it might prefer a candidate from




                                                                       is
                a demographic background that has a lower crime rate, on the grounds
                that the future employee is less likely to steal. The second form of dis-




                                                                bl
                crimination is taste-­based. An individual may prefer to be surrounded
                                                         Pu
                by co-­ethnics, or people of one sex, and may even be willing to lose
                out financially by, for example, hiring less qualified men over talented
                women because they are considered better company.
                    Civil rights law, in theory, and usually in practice, makes both kinds
                                                    s

                of discrimination illegal for protected categories. This leads to some
                                         lin


                strange moral and legal outcomes. Let’s say you believe that people who
                wear baseball caps are more likely to have criminal records and be prone
                to theft. It would therefore be legal to simply refuse to hire anyone who
                                ol



                shows up to a job interview wearing a baseball cap. However, if it can be
                shown that a certain race is more likely to wear baseball caps, the same
                    rC




                practice becomes arguably illegal. Government efforts to do away with
                taste-­based discrimination lead to similar absurdities. I may dislike peo-
        pe




                ple who are too loud or too tall and discriminate against them, but not if
                my dislike of these traits disproportionately disadvantages members of
                a protected class. Height-­based discrimination might even be legal in a
ar




                city where the population was made up of blacks and whites, two races
                that are approximately equal in stature, but violate civil rights law in one

                where the population is white and Hispanic.
                    The beauty of markets is that people are free to make such decisions
                for themselves. As with many other things, some women like to be in

                past the eighth grade. The religious freedom of parents outweighed
                the interests of the state in educating the child. This decision paved
                the way for granting more rights to families that wanted to homeschool

                became legal in all fifty states in the early 1990s. As the legal scholar
                and philosopher Brian Leiter argues, religion is given special status in
                American law, allowing people not to comply with mandates they would
                otherwise be required to follow.36 While this trend has unquestionably




                                                                                        rs

                free from government interference. Given this context, civil rights law
                does something very strange. On most questions, the American system
                takes a relatively laissez-­faire attitude toward the economy and the cul-




                                                                       is
                ture. Yet it also engages in social engineering when it comes to the pri-
                vate sector. This is no small matter in a society where people spend large




                                                                bl

                coworkers than members of their own families.
                   It is important to stress that, because of how broad and vague most
                of its proscriptions are, civil rights law does not simply make views or
                attitudes that are clearly bigoted illegal. Even conservative political

                views, or views held by a majority of the population, can be problem-
                                         lin


                atic. For decades, polls have shown that Americans oppose race-­and
                sex-­conscious programs in college admissions and in the workplace.37
                While one can sometimes get a contradictory result by framing the
                                ol



                question differently in a way that obscures what affirmative action ac-
                tually looks like, when voters have gone to the polls to decide on such
                    rC




                programs, they generally vote against them. This was true even in Cal-
                ifornia, a state where the voters in 2020 rejected affirmative action in
        pe




                the public sector and in university admissions by a vote of 57 percent
                to 43 percent.
                   Opposition to affirmative action is therefore about as mainstream
ar




                a position as one can find. Yet color-­blindness or gender-­blindness,
                whether in terms of speech or practice, is illegal for major employers.

                Americans who talk about politics are used to being able to debate
                questions such as the causes of group differences and how much public
                policy should seek to equalize outcomes between different races. In the
                workplace, however, the practical impact of civil rights law can be to
                create an environment in which only the left-­wing position is permitted,

                liability.
                   Occasionally, those making and interpreting civil rights law have
                made their intentions explicit. As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
                wrote in 1988,




                                                                                         rs
                    In essence, while Title VII does not require an employer to fire all “Ar-

                    chie Bunkers” in its employ, the law does require that an employer take
                    prompt action to prevent such bigots from expressing their opinions in
                    a way that abuses or offends their co-­workers. By informing people that




                                                                        is
                    the expression of racist or sexist attitudes in public is unacceptable,
                    people may eventually learn that such views are undesirable in private,




                                                                  bl
                    as well. Thus, Title VII may advance the goal of eliminating prejudices

                   In other words, speech and conduct deemed “offensive,” defined
                by courts and bureaucrats of course, is to be purged not only from the

                cial engineering is a legitimate function of government, but what cannot
                be denied is that practically no Americans thought this was what they
                were signing up for in 1964.

                   Civil rights law legitimizes some identities while delegitimizing oth-
                ers. It therefore pretends to speak for the powerless and marginalized,

                as it may immunize an individual against groupthink and allow him
                to see certain truths that others are better at avoiding. In 2021, Elon

                to either favor or place obstacles in the way of people with Asperger’s
                syndrome. No state is wise enough to understand in what contexts the
                traits associated with that condition are beneficial for society, and when
                they cause too much distress or disruption to be tolerated. Markets and

                   A thought experiment can show the absurdity of government at-
                tempts at social engineering. Courts have ruled that sex stereotypes can
                be a form of discrimination on the job. A woman who acts too “mas-

                culine” by arguing with her colleagues and interrupting them during
                meetings cannot be “discriminated” against based on these behaviors,




                                                                bl

                passive to manage employees—­and is not promoted for that reason, she
                has no legal recourse. In other words, the government maintains that
                defending masculine behavior in women is something worth restricting

                more generally. A woman who has too feminine a demeanor for her em-
                ployer’s liking might have a disparate impact claim, if anything, though
                here a business necessity defense would be available. It would not be

                available if an employer fired the masculine woman.
                   Practically, of course, trusting courts and bureaucrats to make such
                    rC




                determinations requires them to have unrealistically high levels of in-
                formation and discernment. In the real world, if a woman says that she
        pe




                was fired for behaving in a traditionally masculine manner, few employ-
                ers are likely to respond that they would have tolerated her behavior up
                to a certain level, but that she was acting so obnoxiously that they would
ar




                have also fired her had she been a man. One would have to prove to so-
                cial engineers the level of masculine behavior that a workplace finds ac-

                ceptable in men, and show that this woman crossed that threshold. How
                does one prove such things? In effect, firms in many cases must end
                up placing limits on traits associated with extreme masculinity among
                men, while encouraging them among women.
                   Are the above ruminations absurd? If so, it is only because civil rights

                the power it puts into the hands of judges and unelected bureaucrats;
                and the trust it puts in their judgments. Human relations are complex,

                to navigate the social world, mostly without explicit rules about appro-
                priate standards or behavior. Religious traditions and bottom-­up social

                rival. In practical terms, the benefits of the free markets are much more
                extensive. Each individual who is taking an active role in commerce has
                an endless number of decisions to make. At what scale should a firm
ar




                exist? If one does have employees, how does one motivate them to put
                forth their best efforts? What image should the individual or company

                providing a good or service present to the world? Reasonable minds can
                differ on all of these questions, and many others, and the answer to each
                of them will depend on factors such as the technical requirements nec-
                essary to provide the good or service and the local market in which the
                firm is operating.

                   Capitalism does not guarantee optimal societal outcomes—­such a
                thing is too much to hope for. But it aggregates information in a way
                like no other process on earth, and produces a result that, if not per-
                fect, continuously builds on previous improvements and makes people’s
                lives better.




                                                                                  rs
                   This is why the standardization of the American workplace that re-
                sulted from civil rights law has likely had such disastrous effects on




                                                                          he
                productivity. A series of practices, such as structured interviews, the
                deemphasizing of tests, and HR departments managing social relations
                did not emerge necessarily because they reflected the best ways to run a




                                                                        is
                business. Rather, they emerged as a compromise between market pres-
                sures that reward productivity and aggregate human preferences, on




                                                                  bl

                   In addition to issues related to economic efficiency, the practice of
                social engineering, as alluded to above, also prevents the culture from
                developing in organic ways that reflect the underlying preferences of
                                                    s

                individuals. The discussion thus far has drawn a line between economic

                productivity and taste-­based discrimination. In reality, however, the
                two must be balanced, and we have no way to do so other than through
                markets. If women and non-­whites have something to contribute in a
                                ol



                market economy—­and they of course do—­then it is overly simplistic
                to believe that they have no bargaining power in their interactions with
                    rC




                white men. At some point, discrimination against a particular group
                presents an incentive to hire them, and the market will be constantly
        pe




                selecting against taste-­based prejudice.41
                   Private-­sector discrimination may unfairly harm some groups, but
                there is a limit to the extent to which that can happen in a free market.

                   Through civil rights law, government still allows individuals to live
                how they want in the private sphere, but the space of the private sphere
H




                has been shrinking. One can choose one’s spouse, friends, and fellow
                church members based on any criteria one wants, but not one’s cowork-
                ers, employees, neighbors, or even, in some cases, roommates. Yet work
                is not simply a place to make money, and it should not be turned into a
                sanitized environment in which the only possible values are efficiency

                Government is not wise enough to know the best ways to produce man-
                ufactured goods and get them to the consumer. Why do we believe
                that it has the wisdom to regulate no less complicated issues related to
                friendship, humor, and romance?

                the Court found that the protections that religious institutions have
                against anti-­discrimination laws go beyond a narrowly defined “minis-
                terial exception,” and also apply to other employees, in this case those

                for the rest of life. As a matter of simple logic, more diversity within

                   Younger generations are less likely to marry or have children, and

                have often proved disastrous. Political power and the search for spir-

                way. Under a legal system that allowed more institutional diversity, it is
                not difficult to imagine firms taking a more laid-­back approach to how
                employees interact with one another, or even deciding to take steps to
                actively facilitate the forming of personal relationships. If individuals

                    Even larger and more diverse firms have lost the ability to experi-

                Chinese tech giant Alibaba, which included uncomfortable questions

                employees are hired as replaceable widgets, with interpersonal chem-

                One problem with this theory is that during the period in recent history

                white Americans were not opposed to any attempts to improve the sit-
                uation of blacks. The Civil Rights Act was framed as a bill that would
                primarily end Jim Crow and ensure nondiscrimination in employment

                eminently sensible.

                of 1964 promised and how it would be interpreted. In less than a de-

                for discrimination through the lens of disparate impact, and mandat-

                broad reinterpretation of the CRA was not the only thing that shifted

                the results themselves are indisputable, and they tell us that racial

                their sex and race, and that checking white or male is almost always

                “sexism” against different targets.
                   On this point, the liberal columnist Jonathan Chait has written about

                how “the left is gaslighting Asian Americans about college admissions.”55
                He notes that elite universities use soft quotas because they do not want

                of admissions on the false premise that they do no such thing. Chait is
                right, but he does not go far enough, as the entire affirmative action sys-
                tem is built on lies, including when it discriminates against white peo-

                    One might hold that racial set-­asides and preferences are a way to
                achieve social peace, even if they cannot be justified constitutionally
                or through an honest argument that would be found convincing by the
                broad public. There are a few problems with this view. First, there is
                little evidence that we gain social peace from the lies that surround

                the history of the nation. This famously puzzled President Johnson,
                although it did not cause him to rethink his premise that racial pref-

                doing so would prevent riots in the future.57 Nixon accepted similar logic

                dence against the theory that poverty and discrimination are the “root
                causes” of violence. Thomas Sowell’s study of affirmative action across

                group tensions.59

                a purpose instead of being the result of bureaucratic inertia and the ef-

                Up until now, this book has skated over a puzzle that has been mostly
                only hinted at. Current interpretations of civil rights law are massively
                unpopular. Moreover, most of the post-1964 innovations are based on
                actions taken by the executive branch and the judiciary, but Republi-

                best marginal changes to the status quo. At worst, as during the admin-

                    Given that championing an anti-­woke policy agenda should unite Re-

                on civil rights excesses but allowed government bureaucracy to move
                forward on issues such as disparate impact and consent decrees that
                mandated racial balancing. This is because Republican elites, while

                antagonistic to the civil rights establishment and often intimidated by a
                hostile media landscape. This changed with the election of Ronald Rea-
                gan in 1980. From 1981 to 2008, we saw the second era, one in which

                the other side was split. Reagan and those around him did more to push

                disagreements within his cabinet and resistance in Congress prevented
                him from taking decisive action. The administration of George H. W.

                    After the 2008 election, we started to see the culmination of de-

                charge of the Republican Party. On a wide range of issues—­including

                Conservatives grew increasingly concerned with wokeness as a cultural
                phenomenon while ignoring its origins in policy. This coincided with a

                Republicans in the 2016 election fell in love with Trump in part because
                he made liberals angry, but he was the only major GOP candidate to ex-

                with modern problems.

                against the non-­protected. For a Reaganite or libertarian, using govern-
                ment power to roll back the excesses of civil rights law is no more phil-
                osophically problematic than reducing environmental regulations or
                lowering taxes. Doing so is not only something libertarians shouldn’t
                feel uncomfortable about, it is something they should actively support.

                in particular would “require for their effective execution the creation of
                a police state.” Goldwater was correct on that point, even if the creation

                   As discussed below, Ronald Reagan himself, the bogeyman of much
                of the new right, did much more than any other Republican president in
                recent history to push back against civil rights law. Nationalists, liber-

                move on to issues that are potentially more divisive within the party.

                mentioned in the previous chapter, almost every time affirmative action
                has been on the ballot it has lost. What makes these results all the more
                impressive is that the pro–­affirmative action side is often much better
                funded and has the support of prestigious and powerful institutions. In

                2020, when affirmative action was on the ballot in California, the state

                margin of 29.2 percent over Trump. The side in favor of racial preferences
                outspent the opposition by 19 to 1 and could count among its ranks, ac-
                cording to the Associated Press, the “chambers of commerce, tech com-

                panies, sports teams and Democratic leaders.”7 The other side was “fueled

                positions and found affirmative action to be the second most unpopular.8
                More recently, a different firm conducted a survey of Democratic voters
                in which they were asked to choose their three most important issues
                for Biden and Congress to pass legislation on. Structural inequality, in

                   Framing the topic in other ways can lead to different results. If re-
                spondents are asked about “affirmative action programs” or how they
                feel about “ensuring nondiscrimination,” polls often indicate majority

                support.10 This is an old trick in polling: a question is presented as a bi-
                nary choice with no downside, and one gets a predetermined result. For
                    rC




                example, a pollster may ask whether people want to protect the environ-
                ment, without mentioning that this may require higher gasoline costs.

                A better question would indicate the trade-­offs involved. When Ameri-
                cans are given information about what modern civil rights law actually
                looks like, they recoil. For example, between 1977 and 1989 Gallup asked
ar




                Americans whether “women and minorities should be given prefer-
                ential treatment in getting jobs and places in college” or if “ability, as
H




                determined by test scores, should be the main consideration.” In each
                of four polls, Americans favored ability as determined by test scores by
                over an 8-to-1 margin.11 Ballot initiatives require clarity about what is or
                isn’t allowed, which is why affirmative action performs poorly when put
                to a direct vote.

                    Polls and ballots may still underestimate just how unpopular civil
                rights law would be if people had a better understanding of how it works.

                On many issues, conservative principles lead Republicans to champion
                positions that are unpopular, like entitlement reform. In contrast, when
                conservatives have principles that put them on the right side of public

                little as they have talked about civil rights excesses, they have done even
                less. To understand the conservative movement and its relationship
                with civil rights law, it is worth looking at developments in each of the

                three major news stations. While most journalists saw themselves as

                   This does not mean that the bias was so pervasive and effective that
                liberals could make reality bend to their will. The Great Society legisla-
                tion passed by Congress in 1964 and 1965 was widely popular. But Amer-

                pathologies, but they were soon followed by levels of urban crime and

                approximately doubled over the course of the 1960s, and violent crime
                more generally increased fivefold between 1960 and 1992.13 The fact that
                the increase in crime was overwhelmingly concentrated precisely where
                Great Society legislation aimed to help—­that is, in the inner cities—­

                vote accordingly, policymaking shifted from Congress to the federal bu-
                reaucracy and the courts. Moreover, while the media, which was highly
                centralized and liberal, could only change public opinion on issues to a

                   Liberal media bias could not get Americans to like racial quotas, or
                even make them fail to understand that they exist in the first place.

                What it could do, however, was obscure the legal and institutional

                and the nature of any particular policy under discussion. While Ameri-

                   Moreover, prominent conservatives who went along with innovations
                in civil rights law would be portrayed as acting as tolerant statesmen,
                while those who resisted would be painted as bigots. It did not matter if

                public has never been composed of policy wonks, and a media with cen-

                used the backlash to the Great Society and its effects to win votes—­with
                Nixon himself being the greatest beneficiary. Nonetheless, the political

                   The failure of conservatives to arrest the progress of civil rights law
                was not completely Nixon’s fault. He made the judiciary a central is-

                the Supreme Court. As of 1969, there were only four Republicans un-
                der sixty serving on any US court of appeals.18 Similarly, conservatives
                were so underrepresented in elite circles that the Nixon administration

                the 1960s, Nixon in power represented the continuation of the revolu-
                tion that had been started under Johnson. On many issues, his admin-

                the president may have been unaware. The Nixon administration also

                    Republicans Divided, 1981–2009
                   On the issue of civil rights, Ronald Reagan was philosophically closer
                to Goldwater than Nixon. Because he was more strongly grounded in
                                ol



                conservative ideology than his Republican predecessors, his administra-
                tion made some efforts to push back on the civil rights establishment.

                Yet they failed due to bipartisan opposition not only in Congress but
                among cabinet officials. On voting rights, the president and his Jus-

                tice Department opposed policies and practices that would have—­by
                mandating the drawing of electoral boundaries and instituting voting

                to sign an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1982 after it received
H




                veto-­proof majorities in both houses of Congress.24 The bill increased
                the stringency of federal supervision of the electoral systems and of the
                practices of states and localities, judging their acceptability based on
                whether they elected enough black candidates, not simply whether they
                protected the right of individuals to vote.

                   Reagan had a bit more success in pulling back the scope of affirmative
                action, albeit temporarily. His appointees and staff worked on several
                initiatives that eventually failed, due to resistance from within and out-
                side the administration. These included proposals to reduce the number
                of contractors that had to produce affirmative action plans by three-­

                quarters; reduce the frequency of affirmative action compliance reports
                from annual to once every five years; close the OFCCP; and end goals

                and timetables for private firms.25
                   In general, it was the Department of Justice that was most consis-
                tently conservative on these issues, and when it tried to act in ways




                                                                        is
                consistent with the policy wishes of the president, it faced pushback
                from Labor and other agencies. At the EEOC, Clarence Thomas, then




                                                                  bl
                chairman, stopped approving agreements with employers accused of

                discrimination that included goals and timetables. Fewer contractors
                were disbarred for noncompliance with government affirmative action
                policies, and the EEOC and OFCCP both saw staffing cuts, with the lat-
                ter shrinking by over half between 1979 and 1985 to fewer than one thou-

                   The Reagan administration was fairly cautious in its approach to
                affirmative action in its first term. This began to change after the ap-
                pointment of Ed Meese as attorney general in early 1984 and the presi-
                                ol



                dent’s landslide reelection victory that same year. In 1985, Meese drafted
                an executive order that would have prohibited the OFCCP from using
                    rC




                statistical evidence to charge contractors with discrimination.27 In the
                words of Raymond Wolters, conservatives saw an opportunity: “With
        pe




                the stroke of a pen, they believed, President Reagan could deliver a
                crushing blow against quotas and put an end to the government’s policy
                of forcing firms with federal contracts to practice racial discrimination.”
ar




                   Secretary of Labor Bill Brock argued for a small revision to EO 11246
                that emphasized the color-­blind language of the Civil Rights Act. The
H




                right-­leaning press, in contrast, held that now was the time to act, given
                the president’s recent electoral mandate. Reagan unquestionably sym-
                pathized with the more strenuous critics of affirmative action. Yet in
                early 1986, as a result of media coverage of the debate going on within
                the administration, 69 senators—­including Majority Leader Bob Dole

                and 24 other Republicans—­and 180 members of the House sent a let-
                ter urging the president not to sign Meese’s executive order.28 While
                Republicans had the Senate, Democrats had come out of the 1984 elec-
                tion with a 72-seat majority in the House, despite having lost 16 seats.
                Faced with such overwhelming political pressure, Reagan punted and

                never signed the proposed executive order. Despite the fact that most
                Americans opposed racial quotas, civil rights activists and journalists




                                                                           he
                sympathetic to them were able to make life difficult for conservatives in
                the Reagan administration.
                   Also during Reagan’s second term, in 1987 Congress passed the Civil

                Rights Restoration Act, which said that institutions that received federal
                funds had to comply with Title VI and Title IX in all areas of operation.




                                                                  bl
                This was in response to the Supreme Court decision Grove City College v.

                Bell (1984), which held that under Title IX the government could only
                threaten to cut funding off from the program or activity of a school or
                university that was found to be engaging in discrimination. Reagan ve-
                toed the bill, but the veto was overridden via nearly unanimous support

                Republicans voting against it (73–94). Just under two-­thirds of Senate

                civil rights issues during the 1980s: Democrats united in more strenuous
                enforcement, Republicans about evenly split. Congress was therefore
                    rC




                able to pass the bill, and even override the president’s veto the next
                year. One can hardly exaggerate the importance of the Civil Rights Res-

                toration Act; Grove City had effectively ended OCR jurisdiction over
                athletics for a few years.29 Under the Supreme Court’s interpretation of
                Title IX, the Department of Education no longer had jurisdiction over

                college sports, because the federal government did not provide money

                    Reagan and many of those around him clearly wished they could go
                further on rolling back the excesses of civil rights law. Democrats were
                only able to stop the president because they had help from Republican

                    After the 1984 election, Republicans were still a minority in the House

                acting from genuine conviction or political pressure. Mainstream media
                reports on the debate over government contracting within the Reagan
                administration would often include accusations of racism from civil
                                                    s

                    As the Grove City decision and its aftermath reveal, during the Repub-
                licans Divided era the judiciary was moving to the right faster than other
                                ol



                parts of government, as Republican appointees were grounded in con-
                servative philosophy and relatively immune to the kinds of media pres-
                    rC




                sures faced by politicians. Yet Democratic unity on civil rights issues
                and Republican internal strife ensured that any judicial victories would
        pe




                go to waste. By 1989, Republicans had controlled the White House for
                all but four of the last twenty years, and in that period appointed six of
                the nine justices then sitting on the Supreme Court. This included John
ar




                Paul Stevens, who came to vote with liberals on hot-­button issues, but
                enough of the Republican appointees had a conservative judicial philos-
H




                ophy to significantly change the nature of the Court.
                    This was reflected in two major cases in 1989. In Wards Cove Packing
                Co. v. Antonio, a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that having a
                different percentage of whites and minorities in different jobs did not
                create a prima facie case for discrimination. Disparate impact was not

                show which practices resulted in the relevant disparity, not simply point
                to the fact that a disparity existed. The Court held that if a statistical dis-

                tant Supreme Court rulings in this area would be overturned. The Amer-
                icans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibited discrimination against the
                disabled, and went beyond the Civil Rights Act in requiring employers to

                provide “reasonable accommodations” and imposing accessibility man-
                dates in public accommodations. More controversy accompanied the
                    rC




                debate that would ultimately culminate in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
                In October 1990, Bush vetoed its predecessor bill on the grounds that, in
        pe




                his words, it “employs a maze of highly legalistic language to introduce
                the destructive force of quotas into our national employment system.”33
                   He was in a politically precarious position, as the bill had enough bi-
ar




                partisan support that it was shy of a veto-­proof majority by only two
                votes in the Senate and twelve in the House. After the midterm elections,
H




                Democrats would be in an even stronger position, and the administra-
                tion and Congress came to an agreement on the Civil Rights Act of 1991,
                which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed by
                the president. For the first time, the bill allowed for punitive damages
                under Title VII, capped at $300,000 for the largest corporations and at

                onto the employer for showing that a practice that had a disparate im-
                pact was “job related for the position in question and consistent with
                business necessity” in order to avoid a violation of Title VII.
                   Bush justified signing the Civil Rights Act of 1991 after vetoing its

                note the parallels with what happened in Nixon’s first term, when the

                the nature of the reforms he enacted, even down to disingenuously de-

                   As discussed above, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, overshadowed by

                concepts like “discrimination” and “harassment” led to an explosion
                in EEOC complaints and Title VII lawsuits. The election of 1994 again

                the Republicans made were massive: they picked up eight seats in the
                Senate and fifty-­four in the House, winning the latter body for the first

        pe




                “pursue an all-­out effort to end affirmative racism in America.”36 Yet
                congressional Republicans came to defer to the only two black mem-
                bers of their caucus on the issue. Gary Franks of Connecticut wanted
ar




                to move ahead with taking apart affirmative action, while J. C. Watts of
                Oklahoma tried to put the brakes on any such efforts.37 In July 1995, the
H




                Senate defeated a measure to end federal contract set-­asides for women
                and minorities by 61–36. The Washington Post reported at the time that
                Republican congressional leaders “found that the issue is more divisive
                within their party than some had initially believed” and “have demon-
                strated little enthusiasm for an emotionally wrenching debate.”38 Soon

                after, Bob Dole introduced the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, which
                would have prohibited or limited affirmative action in government con-
                tracting and employment, effectively undoing the legacy of EO 11246
                and decades of EEOC regulations and court decisions. The bill never
                went to a vote.39

                    Sometime in 1995, Republican leaders apparently concluded that win-
                ning the public relations battle over affirmative action was hopeless,

                and they stopped talking about the issue. In 1996, Dole selected as his
                running mate Jack Kemp, an outspoken supporter of racial preferences
                who promised that he would use his influence in the party to make sure

                    The issue after that point was mostly forgotten. Continuing a long-­
                term trend of ideological sorting between the parties, meaning that
                more specific positions come to be clearly associated with one side of
                the aisle or another, the administration of Bush the younger was more

                saying much, and the administration was still to the left of the average
                American voter, being unwilling to even go as far as supporting policies
                that had been enacted through ballot initiatives in states like California.

                    When the Supreme Court was considering Gratz and Grutter in 2003,
                Bush gave a statement opposing the affirmative action programs at the

                University of Michigan then under consideration while stopping short
                of saying that all racial preferences were unconstitutional.41 And unlike
        pe




                under Reagan, there was no real attempt to roll back civil rights ex-
                cesses through the executive branch, although decades of conservative
                appointments to the judiciary did continue to have an impact on the law

                    As it had with the doctrine of disparate impact in the 1980s, the Su-
H




                preme Court in 1999 started pushing back on the expansive interpre-
                tations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In Sutton v. United Air
                Lines, Inc. (1999), the Supreme Court allowed courts and employers
                to consider mitigating measures to determine whether an individual
                is disabled, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams

                (2002) narrowed the concept of “disability” to mean something that
                hinders the ability of an individual to carry out daily tasks, not some-
                thing that simply prevented one from doing a specific job. In response,
                Congress passed and President Bush signed the ADA Amendments Act
                of 2008, which set a broad standard for what counts as a disability and




                                                                                    rs
                prohibits considering mitigating measures. Hence alcoholism is now
                clearly a disability under the ADA, even if an individual could at any




                                                                          he
                moment decide to stop drinking.
                    The ADA Amendments Act passed through a voice vote in the Sen-
                ate and an initial vote of 402–17 in the House.43 Incredibly, one of the




                                                                        is
                changes of the law was to strike from the record a congressional finding
                used to justify the ADA saying that 43 million Americans had some form




                                                                  bl
                of disability. This was used by the Supreme Court in Sutton to find some

                limit to the number of Americans who could be covered. In that particu-
                lar case, it meant excluding those with poor vision, of which there were
                nearly four times that number.
                    Having the ADA cover only one-­sixth of the American population was
                                                    s

                activists. The divergence here between the Court and politicians, in-
                cluding Republican politicians, can likely be explained by the fact that
                while civil rights law as applied to race and gender had become polariz-
                                ol



                ing by the late Bush administration, disability law was still approached
                in the same way civil rights more generally were under Nixon. The Su-
                    rC




                preme Court actually listened to the arguments of disability activists
                and rejected them once it understood how radical they were, while pol-
        pe




                iticians outsourced their thinking to those claiming to speak for what
                was perceived to be a sympathetic minority, even if the law Congress
                passed made them into an official majority. The ADA Amendments Act
ar




                would be the last major civil rights law that was debated and ultimately
                enacted by a near consensus in Washington without major opposition

                law. I choose 2010 because it was the year that the Tea Party movement
                achieved electoral victories, with ideologically committed conservatives
                knocking off a series of establishment figures in primary elections and
                Republicans performing well in the midterms. Mitt Romney had been a

                moderate for most of his career, but would have to grovel before con-
                servatives in order to secure the Republican nomination for president




                                                                           he
                in 2012. The conservative takeover of the Republican Party had been
                ongoing since Goldwater’s nomination, but by 2010, with the end of the
                Bush presidency and the electoral loss of John McCain, we can say that




                                                                         is
                the process had become mostly complete.
                   This means more polarization on civil rights law, which has simply




                                                                  bl
                been a part of greater polarization more generally and a likely contribu-

                tor to it. An analysis of congressional voting patterns shows steady po-
                larization in both houses of Congress from the 1960s to the late 1970s,
                before it took off and increased at a more or less consistent rate up to
                the present day.44 While in the past there was some overlap in voting
                                                    s

                behavior between the most liberal Republicans and the most conser-

                vative Democrats, since around 2010 there has been practically none.45
                Increasing polarization does not necessarily mean that Republicans are
                getting more conservative and Democrats more liberal, only that the
                                ol



                two parties vote more differently on the laws that Congress actually
                considers. Thus while both parties are more in favor of gay marriage
                    rC




                than they were in the late 1990s, such a fact would be unlikely to be re-
                flected in the data. Nonetheless, the most casual review of the programs
        pe




                and initiatives supported by Nixon and Ford, when compared to most of
                the policies favored by Republicans since 2010, confirms that the data
                gathered by political scientists on congressional voting reflects trends
ar




                that are consistent with what is happening on the right and left more
                generally.
H




                   One explanation of conservative neglect of civil rights issues in this
                era is the fact that the US has been experiencing increasing education po-
                larization over the last few decades.46 Republicans are the less educated
                party, particularly underrepresented in policymaking circles and among
                elite college graduates. While there is a conservative intellectual elite,

                the movement as a general matter finds it less natural to connect its
                concerns to public policy. There are simply fewer activists, journal-
                ists, and legal scholars on the right than on the left, with the views and

                from state legislators and members of Congress, who are more reflec-

                   Writing in 2018, R. Shep Melnick lists twenty-­eight times Congress

                stronger or more expansive. In general, major civil rights bills have become less

                    We see the three eras discussed in this chapter reflected in the graph
                above. During the Bipartisan Cartel era, that is, before Reagan came
                into office, congressional Republicans overwhelmingly supported the
                Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, the Civil Rights Attor-
                ney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act




                                                                                    rs
                of 1978. Vote tallies on the next three bills reflect the fact that Re-
                publicans were divided on civil rights legislation over the next few




                                                                          he
                decades. The Civil Rights Restoration Act was supported by a major-
                ity of Republican senators and a minority of House members, which
                was enough to overcome President Reagan’s veto. By 1990, there was




                                                                        is
                a major split between the parties, as most Republicans voted against
                the Civil Rights Act of that year, which President Bush vetoed. The ver-




                                                                  bl
                sion of the bill voted on in 1991 passed with overwhelming support and
                                                         Pu
                was signed by the president, but only after congressional debates that
                reflected deep policy differences between the parties. By the time of
                the Lilly Ledbetter Act and, twelve years later, the Equality Act, views
                on major civil rights legislation were nearly perfectly correlated with
                                                    s

                party: all Democrats were for these bills, while almost all Republicans
                                         lin


                were against them.
                    As mentioned above, an exception to this pattern was the ADA
                Amendments Act of 2008, in which a bipartisan consensus reminiscent
                                ol



                of the 1970s prevailed. Yet even on the disabilities issue, something
                shifted with the rise of the Tea Party. In 2012, the Senate was consider-
                    rC




                ing a UN treaty on discrimination against the disabled modeled after the
                ADA. Bob Dole’s wife rolled him onto the floor, but still thirty-­eight out
        pe




                of forty-­six Republicans voted against the treaty, and it was rejected.49
                Given Sen. Dole’s role in passing the ADA, the Republican rejection of
                this UN treaty in his presence was highly symbolic of how much had
ar




                changed.
                    In 2017, Republicans in the House, with support from a handful of
H




                Democrats, voted to pass the ADA Education and Reform Act, aimed at
                stopping frivolous lawsuits and reducing business costs. In retrospect,
                it looks as if the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 was the end of the bi-
                partisan consensus in favor of stronger federal laws to protect the dis-
                abled, meaning that the issue today is almost as politically divisive as

                the area of disability law came decades after polarization on other civil
                rights issues, but the direction of the move in each case has been similar.
                   The failure of congressional Democrats to make discrimination
                against LGBT Americans illegal under federal law also reflects the new




                                                                                    rs
                reality, and although the 2020 ruling in Bostock gave them much of what
                they wanted, they have been unable to go any further. In February 2021,

                the Democratic-­controlled House passed the Equality Act, which would

                levels of polarization, getting major legislation on social issues through

                has become extremely difficult. The continuing existence of the filibus-

                makes passing two houses of Congress and obtaining a presidential sig-
                nature that much more daunting.
                   Looking only at the percentage who vote for the conservative posi-
                                                    s

                                         lin


                consensus model of civil rights lawmaking, as it fails to show all the laws
                that never come to a vote. And there is yet another sign of how much
                things have changed. The Trump administration’s Title IX policies un-
                                ol



                did regulations of a previous president, breaking the cycle of the last
                several decades in which Democratic administrations expanded social

                engineering through OCR and Republicans maintained the novel policy.
                This holds only until the next time a Democrat comes into office and
        pe




                starts the process all over again.51
                   How Republican attitudes have changed on voting rights roughly
                tracks their evolution on civil rights more generally. The original Vot-
ar




                ing Rights Act was passed in 1965, and subsequent amendments were
                adopted in 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992, and 2006. All became law with over-
H




                whelming majorities. As with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the first Vot-
                ing Rights Act was intended to respond to the racial caste system in
                the South; but the legislation quickly became an open-­ended license
                for government social engineering. Republican acquiescence on the is-
                sue was not simply a matter of the party having moderate and liberal

                son, that packing blacks into their own districts maximizes not only mi-
                nority representation in Congress but also Republican representation.52

                   Trump’s victory in the 2016 Republican primaries and his subse-
                quent election to the White House were seen by many as a refutation
                of a previous generation of conservatives and their ideas. Yet while
                Trump the candidate talked like a moderate by, for example, expressing

                islative agenda to Republicans in Congress, and chose his judges and
                cabinet officials based on who was acceptable to the conservative es-
                tablishment. When Republicans had unified control of government in

                Trump’s first two years, their major legislative accomplishment was a
                tax cut that disproportionately benefited the wealthy, and they also

        pe




                   Trump, like other Republicans since the 1960s, was elected largely
                because people vote on cultural issues, not economics.53 Nonetheless,
                at the national level Republicans have proved better at accomplishing
ar




                foreign policy and economic policy goals than they have at doing any-
                thing regarding civil rights law. Perhaps the main reason is that courts
H




                have assumed an unusually large role on social issues, as has the federal
                bureaucracy. Still, decades of Republican power, and the conservative
                influence within the GOP, have meant that the judiciary in particular has
                moved to the right. This gives conservatives more of a chance to have an
                influence on cultural and social issues.

                   Despite only serving one term, President Trump was able to put three
                new justices on the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans serving during
                his administration, though lacking much of a legislative agenda, worked
                hard on pushing judges through the Senate. Trump appointed fifty-­four
                appellate court judges in four years, just one shy of how many Obama




                                                                                  rs

                sides have gone to their respective corners. Republicans have not gone
                back to supporting the Equal Rights Amendment, and Democrats at the
                national level show practically unanimous support for even the kinds of




                                                                         is
                racial preferences that were once controversial on the left. Moreover,
                the days when Republicans would join with Democrats in Congress to




                                                                  bl

                   Yet although the Republican Party has been taken over by conser-
                vatives, civil rights law has not been rolled back, in part because the
                issues involved have lacked salience. And while partisan polarization

                cult to move policy in their preferred direction. This is why the era is
                called Conservative Neglect; because moderates and liberals have left

                the Republican Party, it now generally ignores civil rights law except
                to fight a rearguard action against its expansion. Measures, laws, and
                    rC




                court decisions that were controversial when new have become part
                of the legal, cultural, and social fabric. When an issue related to civil
        pe




                rights becomes politically relevant, Republicans can be expected to
                rally behind the conservative position, with recent controversies over

                the beliefs, generally sensible, that these things aren’t major problems
                in American society; that government would not be well equipped to
                fix them if they were anyway; and that protecting individual rights and

                    Acting on his own instincts and encouraged by conservatives within
                his administration and right-­wing media, Trump took the conservative
                position on major civil rights issues that came to his attention. The ad-

                they conflicted with principles like religious freedom and federalism.54

                Fox News when Tucker Carlson was interviewing Chris Rufo, who had

                done some reporting on critical race theory trainings within the federal
                government. The guest called on President Trump to issue an executive
                order to “stamp out this destructive, divisive, pseudoscientific ideology
                at its root.”56 A few weeks later, he did just that. On January 5, 2021,
                                                    s

                The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department was thinking
                                         lin


                about no longer considering disparate impact as a form of discrimina-
                tion under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The paper noted that the
                administration had been considering the move for two years, and de-
                                ol



                scribed the initiative as “a last-­ditch effort to accomplish a longtime goal
                of conservative legal activists.”57
                    rC




                    The change would have been limited to the Justice Department but
                could have had ripple effects throughout the government. Already in
        pe




                2018, the administration had revoked Obama-­era guidance under which
                the Department of Education would investigate schools that disciplined
                minorities at higher rates than whites, even without discriminatory in-
ar




                tent. The events of January 6 put an end to the possibility of anything
                being done on disparate impact—­even if that policy shift in such a short
H




                period of time had been plausible in the first place—­but the fact that the
                effort was even made shows how far Republicans had come since Nixon
                was pioneering new forms of affirmative action.

                The history sketched above helps show why the time is right for con-
                servatives to act on rolling back the excesses of civil rights law. The
                political and policy benefits of doing so that existed in the past are




                                                                                    rs
                still there, while modern developments only add to the case for ac-

                impact, and the results-­oriented approach to seeking group equality
                that has been the hallmark of civil rights law for half a century now.
                While the public has moved left on other issues, here the conservative

                ballot initiatives.

                   Now, in addition to having public opinion on their side, conservatives

                have three new reasons to act that are the result of relatively recent
                changes in the political environment. The first involves already men-
                tioned shifts within the Republican Party. The moderates who thwarted
                Ronald Reagan’s effort to repeal affirmative action and who made sure

                that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 passed with large bipartisan majorities
                                         lin


                are no longer there. The rise of populism means that, at least on the
                issues involved here, there is a growing faction within the Republican
                Party that is aligned with libertarianism rather than hostile to it. When a
                                ol



                party is internally divided on an issue, decisive action can be impossible.
                Republicans after taking the House in 1994 found that abolishing affir-
                    rC




                mative action split their own caucus while uniting Democrats, tilting the
                playing field in favor of the latter despite there being majority support
        pe




                for the conservative position in the country as a whole. A unified right
                is very important here because of the tendency of the left to misrepre-
                sent their own positions in order to make them more palatable to the
ar




                public. When they get help in such efforts from prominent Republicans,
                what starts as a political advantage for the right can quickly become a
H




                liability. Fortunately, there are few Republicans left willing to side with
                Democrats on these issues.
                   Second, Republicans have not only become more conservative and
                less subject to left-­wing pressure campaigns, but they and their base are

                that conservatives prioritize “owning the libs” over all else has become
                a running joke among liberals and other critics of the right, including
                those within the movement. “Cancel culture” was a theme of the 2020
                Republican National Convention and has been at the center of more

                primaries, but he inspired the most hatred from the other side. To many
                Americans motivated by anger and bitterness toward an elite culture
                that they believe has gone insane, that was enough.




                                                                        is
                   Yet while conservatives know that they hate wokeness, they have had
                a difficult time knowing what to do about it. Trying to fight the phe-

                be easier to make a list of prominent institutions that have not gone
                woke than it would be to count all those that have. Conservatives have
                united around the idea that something has gone terribly wrong, and
                                                    s

                the emotional reaction that is the backlash to wokeness has helped

                solidify a sense of tribalism and an accompanying hatred of an enemy
                that are conducive to taking real political action.
                   Finally, not only are Republican officeholders more likely to be com­­

                pressures operating on them are different. In a 2001 essay, John Skrentny
                    rC




                found that, when he asked Republican congressional staff and think tank
                operatives why the party did not end affirmative action, the first thing
        pe




                they usually mentioned was fear that they would be called racist as their
                views were criticized and misrepresented in the media.58 In the last two
                decades, however, conservatives have grown increasingly immune to
ar




                such concerns, as can be seen perhaps most notably in the rise of Trump
                and in the kinds of culture war legislation being adopted at the state
H




                level. Fox News, along with the growing importance of the internet and
                social networking sites, has helped create a conservative media ecosys-
                tem that has gained influence over Republican policymakers, drowning
                out traditional media and left-­leaning civil rights organizations.
                   Looking back at the 1970s and 1980s, it is striking the degree to

                Reagan administration took positions on civil rights law that would
                have sounded reasonable to most Americans if they could have gotten

                time.59 On the question of civil rights law, if there is anything resembling
                a fair debate, conservatives can win. The way that the left understands
                    rC




                identity issues—­namely their acceptance of a results-­based approach to
                justice and theories such as institutional racism—­is simply unpalatable

                to most Americans. It may be unacceptable to any people anywhere,
                as it is so illogical and full of contradictions that the whole system
                may require constant lying in order to survive. Hence the battle over

                   Our current high level of polarization means that it is easier than
                it used to be for parties to get things done even when those things are
                unpopular. It is interesting that the last three presidents have all seen
                less variation in their approval ratings than any other president since

                Trump presidency, the public did not shift much in its appraisal of the
                job he was doing, with his approval rating staying in the low to mid-
                40 percent range across his entire time in office, except for a dip to
                34 percent after the events of January 6, averaging 41 percent.

                   Contrast this with the record of George H. W. Bush, whose approval
                rating ranged from 29 percent to 82 percent, averaging 61 percent.




                                                                          he

                horizon as he was leaving, did little to change his approval rating over
                time.




                                                                  bl

                more room for ideology to play a role in governance—­something that

                The idea that society needs to be permanently managed for the sake of
                making the sexes interchangeable and doing away with unintentional
                biases—­even when they are based on statistical truths—­appeals to very
                few people. Moreover, despite the fact that the civil rights regime has
                                                    s

                ment still protects the speech rights of individuals when they are not
                on the job, and there are only a limited number of trial lawyers and civil
                rights bureaucrats in the country. This is why wokeness and the assump-
                                ol



                tions that underlie it can still be criticized, at least by those of us not
                under the jurisdiction of an HR office, and businesses and other private
                    rC




                institutions can for the most part still function without becoming com-
                pletely absorbed by issues of race and gender in the way universities
        pe




                have.
                   For these reasons, wokeness is likely easier undone than would ap-
                pear at first glance, despite its having seemingly influenced almost every
ar




                prominent institution in the country. We live under a political duopoly,
                with one of the two major parties strongly united in opposition to woke-
H




                ness as both a cultural and political phenomenon. Once individuals are
                convinced that things can change, and that change can come through
                the political process, the question becomes, what exactly is to be done?
                That is the focus of this chapter.
                   Thankfully, there is low-­hanging fruit in the policy space—­actions

                branch, and the same is likely true to a limited extent for Title VII.

                    The Supreme Court can throw out disparate impact as a violation
                of the Equal Protection Clause the moment it gets the right case. Even
                when it was more liberal, the Court had already shown skepticism toward

                the doctrine, and now it is simply a matter of litigants being strategic in
                getting the matter before the judiciary. Harassment law likewise rests

                and judicial innovations that have little resemblance to the original in-
                tent of the statute it relies on. Once again, the legal arguments here are
                straightforward enough, and do not require new legislation.

                In mid-2020, a tweet went viral claiming that in most states police could
                legally have sex with or rape someone in their custody if the officer
                claimed the act was consensual.1 This was a highly misleading claim, in
                that rape is illegal under all circumstances, and the words of a police of-

                of the statement that was true, however, was also a sort of half-­truth. It
                was correct that in many states there was no law specifically prohibiting
                sex between a police officer and an individual in their custody. But the
                tweet gave the impression that legislators had considered the question
                and in a majority of states decided that they saw nothing wrong with the

                practice. In fact, federal law as of mid-2020 did ban sex between officials
                and inmates in prisons and immigration detention facilities. However,

                Congress had neglected to also criminalize sex between officers and ar-

                states had not bothered to close.

                   There are likely few or no legislators in the country who believe that

                about the issue or brings it to the attention of the public.
                   In a typical year, Congress enacts hundreds of pieces of legislation, and

                Supreme Court uses its discretion to hear fewer than 150 cases of the over
                7,000 petitions for a writ of certiorari.3 State governments, regulatory
                agencies, and lower federal courts likewise selectively use their author-

                on, and they direct their attention to causes when they believe doing
                so can make the world better, or when they feel political pressure to

                a cause may be the only way of provoking action in the judicial and ex-

                high in salience but low in polarization. High in salience and high in
                polarization is a second-­best option, while if no one cares about an issue
                at all, nothing will happen. Table 2 summarizes the idea.

                rectly. Wokeness as law—­for example, affirmative action in government

                to do so. A goal of this book is to move “wokeness as law” from (1) to
                                          lin


                (4), therefore at least making executive branch actions and judicial de-
                cisions possible.
                    Ideally, wokeness as law would be in (3), though this may not be

                achievable. Even if mass opinion opposes affirmative action and color-­
                conscious policy, what matters most is elite opinion, and the nature of
                    rC




                political polarization is such that public opinion among liberals could
                move to the left once conservatives make wokeness as law more salient

                in public life, as happened when Trump ran for president and made op-
                position to immigration a centerpiece of his campaign.
                    One argument of this book is that wokeness as law can relatively eas-
ar




                ily be moved from (1) to (4), which might be enough to bring about sig-
                nificant change, since major innovations in civil rights law have mostly

                undone. Nonetheless, the idea of passing federal legislation should not
                be completely dismissed, although the path to doing so is more difficult
                and uncertain.

                even see) that the only way back to the free country of their ideals was

                at least if by “laws” he means “legislation.” It is true that criticizing the

                    Civil rights law has not been rolled back by Republicans in power
                mainly because the issues involved have stayed below the radar. The
                doctrine of disparate impact, which fundamentally changed the country,

                cess that produced it was even more obscure than normal agency action,
                which is subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. That law requires
                that regulations be subject to a public comment period and makes them
                                ol



                appealable to a court.5 Under federal law, the EEOC does not make rules,
                it provides “guidance,” which in theory gives it less power but in reality

                provides more ability to innovate without any oversight.
                    OCR in the Department of Education has the ability to make rules

                new innovations through Dear Colleague letters that make major pol-

                standards. Affirmative action for federal contractors has its roots in an
                executive order that is nearly half a century old, and the text of the doc-

                ument gives no hint as to what it requires. As with the Civil Rights Act
                and Title IX, the details were to be worked out in federal agencies and
                the courts.

                likely tilt to the conservative side, leading Democrats to be tepid in their
                support for these policies and others like them. But because the main
                developments in civil rights law preceded our current era of extreme
                ideological sorting by party, they today are mainly ignored. New liberal

                When affirmative action is put on the ballot, it almost always loses, re-
                gardless of the political leanings of a state. Legislative votes are less sa-

                the federal level in over thirty years. Yet within the DOJ, the EEOC, and
                the OFCCP, professional activists and those with the most expansive
                definition of discrimination have largely been able to do as they please.

                Ultimately, federal bureaucracies get their funding from Congress and

                    The focus on “woke capital” as a cause rather than the symptom of
                what has gone wrong in our culture reveals a lack of knowledge about
                the extent to which government has been an active player in shaping
ar




                informal rules and norms. There is widespread understanding on the
                political right that old approaches to fighting the left have failed. The

                crucial step for taking political action involves presenting specifics
                about exactly what the reaction to wokeness should look like.
                    The concept of political salience has a different meaning for judges
                than it does for elected officials. As Steven Teles writes in his history

                   Executive orders are the easiest form of action a president, or per-
                haps any official, can take in the American system. This is why presi-

                institutions because of Executive Order 11246 and how that document
                has subsequently been interpreted. It now mandates detailed record

                keeping on the part of employers and all but requires quotas through-
                out major corporations. Only a few years later, in 1969, President Nixon
                    rC




                signed EO 11478, which required affirmative action in the federal gov-
                ernment. A Republican president should amend both these documents
        pe

                record keeping or affirmative action.

                inevitably go back to what they were. While freedom of association
                would be ideal, pressure needs to come from both sides to counter the
                left’s deep commitment to race and sex preferences. A Supreme Court
                decision finding that there is no legal basis under which EO 11246 can
                require affirmative action from contractors would solve this “ping-­pong

                   The disparate impact doctrine has been applied to the federal gov-
                ernment and institutions it funds through Title VI, and through Ti-




                                                                        is
                tle VII to hiring in the private sector and state and local governments.
                Eliminating this standard can be done exclusively through the executive




                                                                  bl
                branch, with executive orders or within individual agencies. This is the
                                                         Pu
                step that the Trump DOJ tried to take in its last days in office. There
                was also consideration of getting rid of disparate impact in the Depart-
                ment of Education and in Housing and Urban Development.8 While the
                standard was never officially revoked, the Trump administration did
                                                    s

                step back from applications it deemed dubious, ending, for example, the

                Obama-­era policy of investigating schools with differential rates of dis-
                cipline between white and black students.
                   Some of the excesses of Title VII can also most likely be taken care

                of through executive action via appointing sympathetic EEOC commis-
                sioners and executive orders. The only complication in this case is the
                    rC




                Civil Rights Act of 1991, which specifies details regarding the burden of
                proof in a disparate impact claim. However, it does not explicitly man-
        pe




                date that standard in the first place, and the reason that the statute is
                vague is because its authors themselves were divided and decided to
                cede the issue to the courts.9 In contrast, the framers of the Civil Rights
ar




                Act of 1964 were unanimous in rejecting disparate impact and wrote
                their objections into the bill. Thus it is reasonable to believe that the ex-
H




                plicit rejection of disparate impact in 1964, reflected both in the legisla-
                tive history and in provisions that have never been repealed, trumps the
                indirect approval of the standard in 1991. The executive branch should,
                in interpreting Title VII, rely on the intent of the Congress that passed
                the Civil Rights Act.

                    Either way, relatively new developments in Supreme Court jurispru-
                dence point to the conclusion that disparate impact violates the Consti-
                tution. It has become well-­established law that all racial classifications
                used by the government to treat citizens differently can only be consti-
                tutional if they pass a test of strict scrutiny, which means that they must




                                                                                     rs
                be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.10 Im-
                portantly, this includes racial classifications meant to help non-­whites,




                                                                            he
                which is why affirmative action cases involving public universities are
                judged under that same standard. Yet this leads to some ludicrous con-
                clusions under disparate impact doctrine. Let us say that an employer




                                                                          is
                wants to use a test of cognitive ability to hire employees, and that the
                employer assumes that, as with all cognitive tests, it should be expected




                                                                     bl
                to reveal a performance gap between whites and blacks. Using that test
                                                          Pu
                is, since Griggs, the textbook case of the kind of action that can lead to a
                disparate impact lawsuit. But not using the test, because whites will do
                too well on it, should in theory run into its own problem under Title VII.
                In fact, here the discrimination is not even unintentional, as in a dis-
                                                    s

                parate impact case, but intentionally meant to exclude a certain group.
                                         lin


                    As made clear in Scalia’s concurrence in Ricci v. DeStefano (2009),
                disparate impact under Title VII is naturally in tension not only with
                the prohibition on intentional discrimination under Title VII but more
                                ol



                fundamentally with the Equal Protection Clause. If the EEOC or some
                other government agency will enforce only certain kinds of disparate
                    rC




                impact claims, that is, those targeting practices that disproportionately
                harm the hiring prospects of non-­whites or women, and will not enforce
        pe




                even intentional discrimination cases when whites or men are harmed,
                this also violates the Fourteenth Amendment.11 Similarly, when the
                OFCCP requires goals and timetables, it is forcing private firms to en-
ar




                gage in racial discrimination, which is constitutionally prohibited. The
                legal arguments here are straightforward once one accepts that dispa-
H




                rate impact and mandatory affirmative action in government contract-
                ing are policies that discriminate against whites.
                    The constitutional problems with disparate impact applied to Ti-

                discrimination—­and, moreover, that this was somehow allowed under
                the Equal Protection Clause. Disparate impact would still be unconsti-

                which violations it goes after, is unconstitutionally vague regardless of
                whether it has statutory authority or not. The argument that it would

                the executive branch and courts is interesting to note, but a moot point

                Title IX to engage in social engineering across schools and universities.

                the agency in turn cites the courts for justification for what it is doing.
                The Trump administration withdrew the Obama-­era regulations in this
                area, but in summer 2022 the Biden administration began the process

                of reinstating similar policies through notice and comment procedure.12

                erwise would be. Nonetheless, even if an administration goes through
        pe




                notice and comment procedure, it cannot go beyond the plain text of a
                statute. Title IX says no student can be “excluded from participation in,
                be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
ar




                education program” on account of sex.
                   The idea that sexual harassment committed not by employees of an

                institution but through actions taken by other students could be a form
                of sex-­based discrimination would have appeared odd to the Congress
                that passed Title IX, and would have been a radical interpretation of the
                statute until the 1990s. Courts are to give more deference to regulations
                that undergo notice and comment procedures than they are to those

                    The path forward on disparate impact is no less clear. There are signs
                that the Supreme Court is poised to act in this area. In Alexander v. San-
ar




                doval (2001), it punted on the question of whether Title VI allowed dis-
                crimination based on disparate impact, but sounded a skeptical note.
H




                Eight years later, Ricci arguably clarified that the Civil Rights Act of 1991
                had written disparate impact into Title VII, while the decision only made
                it slightly more difficult for plaintiffs to win such cases. Justice Scalia
                wrote, in his concurrence, that the decision “merely postpones the evil

                Civil Rights Act of 1964 consistent with the Constitution’s guarantee of

                Like O’Connor, he had a habit of denouncing the more extreme inter-
                pretations of civil rights law, clarifying, for example, that whites are
                just as protected as blacks, and mandating a “strict scrutiny” standard

                constitutional and statutory soundness of that ruling. While conserva-

                   On Title IX, the courts have done an excellent job in striking down

                sexual assault tribunals. They should also revisit long-­held precedents
                about the regulation of sports, which rest not on statutory language,
                or even rules made by a federal agency, but unilateral statements that

                courts should revisit the First Circuit decision in Cohen v. Brown Uni-
                versity, which ratified an OCR policy encouraging balance in the number
                of male and female students participating in sports. There was nothing
                in the plain language of Title IX, and no official rule adopted by OCR,

                   Pushing back against Title IX regulation is low-­hanging fruit in the
                sense that the legal arguments one would rely on are within the main-
                stream of established jurisprudence. At the same time, finding the right
                case that can establish a broad principle is more difficult, though all it

                   Harassment law is an area in which the legal arguments for push-
                ing back against wokeness are straightforward, but an actual decision
                                ol



                would require a somewhat radical break with precedent. Recent decades
                have seen the Court move toward a more absolutist interpretation of
                    rC




                the First Amendment on issues as diverse as hate speech, campaign fi-
                nance laws, and pornography. Yet anti-­harassment law remains siloed
        pe




                from this legal development. It is far from obvious why this should be
                the case. Courts should rely on the arguments put forward by Eugene
                Volokh and others to at the very least acknowledge the trade-­off be-
ar




                tween the First Amendment and the current state of civil rights law.
                The ultimate aim should of course be to make regulating speech in the

                workplace just as difficult and constitutionally problematic as doing so
                anywhere else.
                   Finally, Section 1981 could potentially be a problem and pick up the
                slack in any rollback of Title VII. Right now, the effect of the law is lim-

                firmed that the Reconstruction-­era statute requires but-­for causation
                to make a claim, unlike Title VII, which only requires the plaintiff to
                show that discrimination is a “motivating factor” in any prohibited be-
                havior. The relevant difference between “but-­for causation” and “moti-

                for lawyers but could easily be picked apart by an amateur logician. The

                important thing to understand is that but-­for causation is treated as a
                higher standard. In addition, Section 1981 requires intentional discrim-
                ination and only applies to race, thus making it less relevant than Title




                                                                        is

                them having been much more creative in interpreting its predecessor
                from nearly a century before. Once Title VII is limited to its proper role,
                it will be important to remain vigilant against judges inclined to find

                strain the reach of the law would be an even better option. The Supreme
                Court did not even recognize a private right to action under Section 1981
                until 1975, a fact that the Comcast opinion seemed to attribute to the

                   During my first summer in law school, I worked as an intern for the

                Center for Individual Rights, a conservative nonprofit that had been in-

                law and affirmative action issues. As part of my job, I would sometimes
                search for initiatives and programs at universities that likely violated
                the law. Even when it has upheld affirmative action, one thing that the
ar




                Supreme Court has made clear is that quotas are an unacceptable form
                of racial discrimination outlawed by the Equal Protection Clause. I

                remember once finding a scholarship that a university made available
                to non-­white students only, which struck me as more extreme than
                a quota and the kind of thing that would get thrown out in court. An
                attorney was supervising my work, and when I went to him with what
                I thought was new and interesting information, he made clear that

                such programs were normal. We were a small office with fewer than
                ten employees, even if one counted the second intern and me. I left
                the meeting with the impression that universities and businesses were
                doing things all the time that would be ruled illegal if they came to the
                attention of the Supreme Court. But lawsuits are long and expensive,

                legal areas, is something of a battle of attrition between bureaucrats and
                lawyers. Progress depends not only on getting judges and bureaucrats
                to see things in the way one prefers, but also on galvanizing enough

                   Even if civil rights law helped create wokeness, that does not mean

                that removing its legal underpinnings would immediately change the
                culture. Many major corporations seem committed to the principles of

                yond what the law would require, and the universities are even more ex-
                treme in this regard. What attitude should opponents of wokeness have




                                                                        is
                toward such programs? It can be argued that any anti-­discrimination
                law in the private sector interferes with freedom of association and hin-




                                                                  bl

                male discrimination should be tolerated in the name of these values and
                goals, for the same reasons other forms of discrimination should be.
                   Indeed, as argued in previous chapters, markets can solve the most
                egregious forms of discrimination. Even if they do not, a free country

                make unfair or bad decisions in their personal lives, as long as they are
                willing to suffer the consequences of their actions—­in this case, lost
                profits and financial opportunities that result from discrimination. As
                                ol



                the legal scholar Richard Epstein has pointed out, the classic justifica-
                tion for government abridging freedom of association or freedom of
                    rC




                contract is to account for negative externalities—­that is, costs imposed
                on third parties. But when someone engages in an act of private discrim-
        pe




                ination, they suffer the costs of doing so themselves.22 While third par-
                ties might suffer due to their distaste for discrimination, if we are going
                to take taste-­based preferences into account, there is no principled way

                for society to decide to prefer some people’s desire for integration or a
                society that doesn’t discriminate over those with the opposite prefer-

                ences making decisions about their own private lives.
                   There is thus a philosophically elegant, perhaps irrefutable, libertar-
                ian case for getting rid of all anti-­discrimination laws. Perhaps its logic
                might break down in a society with strong social taboos against mixing
                between groups, as in the Jim Crow South and caste-­based India. Yet

                in modern America, discrimination is culturally taboo, and those who
                want to favor whites or men while doing business are likely to face huge

                civil rights laws as written are generally blind to race and sex. This is

                something that tended to be ignored by the judiciary in earlier decades,
                but by the 1980s, there were Supreme Court decisions emphasizing
        pe




                the fact. Nevertheless, in most institutions today even unintentional
                discrimination against protected groups, defined and interpreted by
                judges, bureaucrats, and lawyers as disparate impact, is forbidden, while

                as anti-­discrimination laws exist at all, institutions need to feel pres-
                sure from both sides in order to achieve some kind of balance. Taking a
                different approach would cause employers and institutions to continue

                Current practice is so far removed from the law as written and originally

                But this is clearly the direction to move in, as it is consistent both with
                sound legal reasoning and public opinion.
                   There does not need to be a trade-­off here. In April 2021, the Project

                free to undertake such initiatives. Moreover, they have likely thought

                the risk is worth taking. This may result from ideological preference,
                or because such programs provide a defense to any charge that could
                    rC




                be made alleging discriminating against groups that civil rights activists
                and lawyers care more about defending. It is impor­tant to change that
        pe




                calculation. While conservatives and libertarians can debate the wisdom
                of anti-­discrimination laws, as long as they are on the books, they have
                to be applied equally across different demographics.

                   One likely cannot expect the EEOC or state civil rights offices to be
                willing to treat all kinds of discrimination equally. The Supreme Court
H




                has made it clear that whites and men are protected by the Civil Rights
                Act and the Equal Protection Clause. But, as Gail Heriot writes, “to my
                knowledge, the EEOC has never brought a disparate impact investiga-
                tion or lawsuit on behalf of white males. Nor has the Supreme Court en-
                tertained a disparate impact case on behalf of anyone other than women

                that the EEOC was the organization that pioneered disparate impact
                and made it part of American law, with the explicit goal of being able
                to do more to root out discrimination against non-­whites and women.

                    Congress could, in theory, abolish disparate impact and EEOC, set
                reasonable standards for Title IX, and limit the breadth and reach of

                   This book has for the most part ignored state law, which in any case
                tends to be less important than federal regulations. But to the extent

                Ron DeSantis did in Florida, can be done at either the state or the fed-
                eral level. The fact that some states tend to be under unified Republican
                control most of the time creates more room for action, and it is worth
                exploring how far things can be pushed.

                    When possible, states should enact the kind of sweeping legislation
                that would be nice to have but is likely impossible at the federal level.
                To repeat, this means banning racial and gender criteria in government

                   The right hates wokeness, but its failures have resulted from seeing
                the phenomenon as simply a cultural trend or class marker rather than

                fabric of government and corporate life that even many critics of woke-
                ness have at most only a faint understanding of their existence.
                   When the resistance to wokeness has stepped into the policy arena,
                it has focused on a few narrow topics, such as the doctrine of critical
                race theory, which had become the basis of education curricula and




                                                                                     rs

                applauded, but they do not yet get at the root of the problem. Many

                of the things conservatives and moderates fight are just surface-­level
                phenomena—­manifestations of what are deeper assumptions and re-

                each, and infer discrimination from statistical patterns. The main differ-
                ence is that critical race theory self-­consciously does away with much of
                the hypocrisy that was inherent in pushing both color-­blindness and a
                disparate impact definition of discrimination while paying lip service to

                   The fight against wokeness will require a pragmatic acknowledgment
                that it is going to have to be Republicans who, in the short run at least,
                                ol



                fight the battle. Understanding and being explicit about this fact may
                mean alienating some natural allies, but it is a necessary concession to
                    rC




                reality. Public opinion surveys show that woke ideas now have wide-
                spread support on the political left, particularly among whites, women,
        pe




                and the highly educated, demographics that have disproportionate in-
                fluence within the Democratic Party. Liberal elites and the institutions
                they run have developed a strong attachment to the equity agenda,

                which is why Democratic politicians tend to overreach in this area. All
                of this may change over time, as Republicans create political costs for

                the left by highlighting, and bringing to the attention of the public, race-­
                and gender-­related issues on which conservatives have an advantage.
                Moderates and open-­minded liberals, too, continue to make the case for
                individual liberty to their own side. For now, however, it will have to be
                conservatives who take the political initiative.

                   It is important to realize that there is no free marketplace of ideas as
                long as civil rights law remains what it is. Institutions are only allowed
                to have certain official positions about the causes of group disparities
                and are forced to be race-­and sex-­conscious as they suppress speech
                and micromanage social relations. I have argued that an anti-­wokeness




                                                                                     rs
                agenda would be politically popular. Even if it wasn’t, however, the bat-
                tle would still be worth fighting, as freedom of speech and freedom of

                conscience are necessary to protect other values. And as long as we have
                “civil rights” as currently defined, all other rights are either in abeyance
                or at the very least in a much weaker state than they should be.

                Societies differ greatly in their attitudes toward issues surrounding

                are protected. The civil rights revolution is now deeply embedded in
                American law. Because of its vagueness and the soft nature of its stan-
                dards and requirements, it has created its own internal bureaucracies
                within major institutions. Enforcement depends only partly on govern-
                ment, being otherwise outsourced to the court system and private par-

                ties, who have access to grievance mechanisms both within and outside

                book like this one, focusing mostly on legal doctrine and developments,
                provides a plan that is adequate to address the challenge, or whether
                there is too much inertia in the system.




                                                                        is
                    This conclusion has two purposes. First, it is to show that wokeness
                is not as strong as it looks. Analogies to religious faith—­which carry




                                                                  bl
                with them the implicit argument that the phenomenon may last for
                                                         Pu
                thousands of years—­rest on a weak foundation. Previous chapters have
                made this argument partly by showing the intellectual shoddiness of
                woke doctrine and the historically contingent nature of its triumphs.
                Nonetheless, even religions that owe their start to state power and with-
                                                    s

                out much internal logic to them can last a very long time, which is why
                                         lin


                we may wonder whether wokeness is here to stay. I argue that it is not.
                    The second purpose is to provide a vision of what a post-­wokeness
                world might look like. This book has by necessity been a work of de-
                                ol



                scription and negation, focusing on where wokeness comes from, why it
                is so harmful, and how to dismantle it. I trust the reader brings his own
                    rC




                philosophical inclinations to a work like this, and may see wokeness as
                a hindrance to other societal goals, whether freedom, economic growth,
        pe




                progress, or social stability. Therefore, this chapter tries to paint a pic-
                ture of what victory over wokeness would look like and how it would
                foster them. That picture is by necessity speculative as is any work of

                fiction, but it can at least give a hint as to what is worth fighting for.

                               Is Wokeness Inevitable, or a Paper Tiger?

                Some have argued that to see wokeness as a phenomenon that can be
                defeated in the short or medium term is unrealistic. They compare it
                to religious faith, which, unlike a political view, is usually seen as much

                deeper and more powerful.1 I’d argue that the definition of religion
                has two key pieces, and both are necessary to consider. Religions are
                of course distinguished by a metaphysical belief system that inspires
                individual passion. But another important aspect of religions, and the
                one that many of those who make the comparison to wokeness ignore,




                                                                                   rs
                is that they are distinguished from other belief systems by their proven
                ability to survive across generations under a wide variety of conditions.




                                                                        he
                    Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and the rest of the world

                Lindy, meaning that because they have been around for a long time we

                can expect them to be around in the future.2 They have survived through
                historical eras in which they have been supported by the state, oppressed

                by it, or treated with indifference. As they have remained strong after an

                human nature causes many to find each of the major world religions
                appealing.
                    Compare this to modern ideologies. Nazism and communism have

                    Nationalism is something in between a religion and a twentieth-­
                century ideology. Its rise has historically been tied to the modern state,
                which usually finds it useful. But sometimes nationalism emerges in
                opposition to existing power, as happened near the end of the Austro-­
                Hungarian, Ottoman, and Soviet empires. At the same time, people can




                                                                                     rs
                assimilate into a new country pretty quickly and forget their old attach-
                ments. Populations changing their national loyalties is more common




                                                                          he
                than the adoption of new religious faiths; it has been noted that when
                Russia moved into eastern Ukraine in early 2022 it found much less sup-
                port among the local population than it had only eight years before.




                                                                        is
                    The key thing to realize about wokeness in this context is that it has
                never faced a real stress test. Its fundamental tenets have been law in




                                                                  bl
                the United States for over half a century. Practically every major nonre-
                                                         Pu
                ligious institution in the country is forced to be conscious of race and
                sex, censor the speech of its employees in the name of sensitivity, act
                as if disparate outcomes are a sign of discrimination, and employ an
                internal bureaucracy to enforce these rules. Wokeness thus has no his-
                                                    s

                tory of surviving without state support. In fact, even with state support,
                                         lin


                and with practically unlimited rhetorical backing from elite institutions,
                it still struggles to win hearts and minds. Wokeness remains mostly a
                political loser for the left, which is why it obfuscates on issues like crit-
                                ol



                ical race theory and the fact that civil rights law in its current form all
                but requires speech restrictions and racial quotas. Wokeness does not

                appear to be able to motivate its adherents to make the extreme kinds
                of sacrifices that are the hallmarks of true religious faith. It can’t even
        pe




                convince liberals to keep their kids in inner-­city public schools.
                    Wokeness may end up not as a religion but something analogous to
                liberal democracy.4 That is, an ideology that contains a blueprint for the
ar




                organization of political life and is taken for granted by much of the
                world. There is a possibility that in future generations color-­blindness

                sensitive employees and government neutrality in matters of culture
                will be seen as outdated—­like the divine right of kings. People will think
                that of course society cannot tolerate massive differences in outcomes
                between groups, and that it is the job of governments to do something

                classes from indignity, particularly women as they become better repre-
                sented in influential institutions, will be seen as requiring compromise
                on that principle. Alternatively, people might come to no such conclu-
                sions, but the laws of political gravity might be such that interest groups

                which governments have a natural tendency to give in to as this devel-

                    Tyler Cowen believes that the world is getting more “woke” and that

                this is a good thing, but he takes the term to mean something akin to
                tolerance in the classic liberal sense. In that formulation, 1950s America

                would be considered more woke than the antebellum South, and Saudi

                Arabia became more woke when it began to let women drive in recent
                years.5 By this standard, there appears to be a greater shift to what we
                can call more left-­wing attitudes on race and sexuality relative to the
                historical norm.6 But if wokeness is defined as an obsession with racial

                and gender disparities, the restriction of speech to overcome them, and

                government programs and private-­and public-­        sector bureaucracies
                meant to undo them, then there is not yet much evidence that wokeness
                can be a major force in society without government backing.
                                ol



                    France provides a counterexample to the American model of the
                management of race and gender issues. Its laws generally ban the state
                    rC




                from collecting data on the race, religion, and ethnicity of individuals.7
                This means that, much to the chagrin of some American liberals, France
        pe




                cannot have disparate impact standards, state-­enforced affirmative ac-
                tion, or even programs targeted at a group with a particular ancestry.
                It is perhaps not a coincidence that in a country that bans the kind of
ar




                data collection necessary to enforce woke policies, we see much more
                resistance to wokeness as a cultural force among the political elite. In
H




                late 2020, the French education minister warned that “there’s a battle to
                wage against an intellectual matrix from American universities.”8
                    President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in similar terms, and he is
                something of a moderate on cultural issues. Suppose his nation is un-
                able to hold wokeness at bay. In that case, this will provide evidence

                either that developed societies naturally drift toward wokeness or, al-
                ternatively, that American elite culture is so strong that it can overcome
                resistance even on the most difficult terrain. It must be said, of course,
                that in some ways wokeness in France appears stronger than in the US,
                mainly due to the existence of hate speech laws. Yet one of the main ar-

                than those in other countries in theory, in reality their speech and be-

                havior are regulated to an unusual degree.
                    As pointed out in chapter 3, the US resembles the French state in not
                collecting religious data, and we are not nearly as woke on religion as




                                                                        is

                again because we do not have the numbers necessary to even begin to
                care. This argues that the degree of wokeness in a country and what
                form it takes are contingent on whether and how certain kinds of data
                is collected.

                                         lin


                seems even weaker. Part of the reason it is difficult to draw conclu-
                sions about such things is that countries do not make up an indepen-
                dent set of observations, since ideas travel across borders and the US
                                ol



                has such a globally powerful cultural influence. Thus if we see homo-
                sexuality becoming more acceptable in most or all countries, is this a
                    rC




                natural consequence of modernity, or just a sign that Hollywood and
                the State Department are everywhere? Nonetheless, there is evidence
        pe




                of growing right-­w ing cultural populism across most of the major
                countries of the world over the last decade, including Brazil, China,
                India, Russia, and Turkey. Even though in most states there does tend
ar




                to be a move toward greater liberalization on matters related to sexu-
                ality, the vast majority of the nations of the world are still far from an

                new sexual orientations.9
                    That said, it is still possible that once you undo the excesses of civil
                rights law, wokeness will remain as strong as ever and eventually show
                itself to be just as capable as major world religions of long-­term viability

                small in its own right but ultimately contributing to a social revolution.

                apolitical, no reasonable person doubts that they are influenced by the

                reach and scope, expanded in executive agencies and the courts without

                more difficult, but in a world where conservatives recognize the impor-
                tance of the issues involved, they will form their own lobbies that seek

                for decades explicitly rejected the idea that anti-­white discrimination
                is more legally acceptable than anti-­minority discrimination. It starts
                paying attention to whether lower courts have actually followed this

                prevents an outcome in which, having rolled back affirmative action and
                disparate impact, Republicans find that institutions nevertheless con-

                lawsuits may still come only from one side. If anti-­discrimination laws
                    rC




                are not going to be repealed, then a world where everyone is protected is
                necessary to prevent institutions from becoming woke to protect them-

                   Getting conservatives to focus on civil rights law also has an effect
                at the state level, which forms another source of pressure pushing back
ar




                on woke institutions. Republicans outside of Washington begin to no-

                back such policies. Leverage is used not only to stop woke policies but
                to mandate race-­and color-­blindness as a precondition for having gov-

                it becomes harder to prove. The acceleration comes in part due to eco-
                nomic developments that include the rise of new firms and industries.
                Established institutions can only change so much. HR departments and

                    New businesses and social arrangements that seem unusual but meet
                human needs begin to emerge. All throughout history, religions, families,

                get married and form families. Under civil rights law, women started
                to enter a workplace that became increasingly sanitized to respond to
                the wishes of the most sensitive and brittle among them. Careers be-

                came more important relative to other areas of life at the same time it
                was made illegal to mix work with love or sexual desire. Unsurprisingly,
                    rC




                fewer and fewer people ended up getting married or having children.
                    In the post-­woke world, some corporations start encouraging dat-

                take many forms, from Christian matchmaking to promoting a party-­

ar




                servative and liberal forms. Other firms explicitly market themselves
                as providing a more “professional” or “classic” work experience. They

                looking for a relationship, and those who simply dislike mixing work
                and love. No law will prevent companies from adopting old EEOC reg-

                will criticize many of these experiments, and they will become the sub-
                ject of public outrage. After civil rights law has been defanged, however,
                government no longer has the ability to easily shut such efforts down.

                an endless stream of belittling insults and large and small acts of dis-

                harassed, and human resources departments in practically every major
                institution would try to get on the right side of the issue. This was
                due to the political leanings of HR professionals and the threat of law-

                This effect remains; even in a world without civil rights laws, compa-

                popular entertainment. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, there was a re-
                alization that popular culture had become decadent, as Hollywood came
                to produce less compelling original material and rely more on remakes

                stories that obviate natural differences between men and women and
                insert unrealistic levels of ethnic diversity that distract from the ability
        pe




                to find inspiration in a work. When the excesses of civil rights law are

                At the same time, historical research, by looking at the order of events,
                can make the case that many of the ideas fundamental to wokeness were
                part of law before they were part of American culture. In other words,

                now the culture war has been an asymmetric fight, with one side able to
                inspire a critical mass of bureaucrats and activists who do their work far
