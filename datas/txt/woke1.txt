                about American politics and culture. It was only in the mid-2010s that
                the subject of “wokeness” came to dominate political discourse. The

                phenomenon seemed to start on college campuses. Within a few years,
                                                       Pu
                it had migrated to other institutions. Those who critique what has hap-
                pened to our institutions tend to think more of style than substance,
                pointing to instances of crying college girls demanding safe spaces, an-
                gry students yelling at their professors over “microaggressions,” and
                                                       s

                public debates litigating the definition of “woman.” From this perspec-
                                         lin


                tive, when wokeness seeps into policy, it is usually in the context of de-
                bates about standardized tests and crime prevention, but it is common
                to see a self-­identified liberal who has an aversion to the aesthetic com-

                ponents of wokeness while accepting most of its policy agenda.
                    Having followed these issues for years, I saw what was happening
                    rC




                differently. To me there was always something off about the main-
                stream liberal worldview when it came to issues of race and sex, and
        pe




                the role of government in preventing discrimination on certain “pro-
                tected” grounds. Such goals, I thought, naturally resulted in misguided
                policies that were destructive in terms of personal freedom, economic
ar




                growth, and even the mental health of much of the public. I had gone
                to law school and spent a summer interning at the Center for Individ-
H




                ual Rights, a public interest firm that fought against overreaches in civil
                rights law. When I saw the rise of what most educated people call woke­
                ness, it seemed to be only the long overdue cultural manifestation of
                assumptions and beliefs that have in many instances been deeply em-
                bedded in American law for over half a century.

                   It is not that culture and aesthetics are unimportant. People can and
                do legitimately debate moral standards, the purpose of art, and the na-
                ture of justice. Wokeness as a cultural phenomenon has something to
                say about all those things, as does the backlash to it. But what I found
                strange about the anti-­wokeness side of the debate was that its propo-




                                                                                        rs
                nents seemed oblivious to the extent to which the beliefs and practices
                they disliked were mandated by law. No act of Congress or federal reg-




                                                                         he
                ulation technically requires one to express the belief that differences
                in income between men and women are due to sexism, but expressing
                the opposite view as a corporation can be extremely costly, and not just




                                                                       is
                because of any potential public relations backlash. In the “marketplace
                of ideas,” the intellectual is free to be a conservative, liberal, libertarian,




                                                                      bl
                or anything else. The corporate executive, however, is only given one
                                                          Pu
                option. For so many public intellectuals and politicians to be anti-­woke
                but indifferent to civil rights law struck me as similar to worrying about
                global warming but not bothering to know anything about energy policy.
                   Of course, something changed in the mid-2010s. But when it comes to
                                                       s

                how major institutions in the country operate, the changes have mostly
                                         lin


                been superficial, at least relative to the magnitude of those that occurred
                decades before. Since at least the 1970s, major corporations have been
                forced to be highly conscious of race and sex and on the lookout for
                                ol



                practices and behaviors that may have a “disparate impact,” which the
                law has considered a sign of discrimination. Since the 1980s, firms have
                       rC




                been all but required to police the speech of their employees to prevent
                them from saying things that might offend women and non-­whites, and
        pe




                since 1991 the most litigious among those workers have been able to re-
                ceive punitive damages in lawsuits, whether or not they suffered career
                consequences. Opponents of wokeness sometimes say that “facts don’t
ar




                care about your feelings.” But the federal judiciary does.
                   As the anti-­woke have observed and noted, corporations today are in-
H




                creasingly likely to make public statements about hot-­button issues and
                pledge support to left-­wing academic ideas. Many firms hold trainings
                about “privilege” that strike most reasonable people as absurd. But when
                it comes to substantive practices regarding how they run their busi-
                nesses and manage employees, there is more continuity than change.

                It is not difficult to understand why the current discourse would miss
                all of this. The conceptual similarities between principles of civil rights
                law and wokeness are easy enough to explain, but the burdens that the
                law imposes on employers and workers tend to have indirect and com-
                plicated effects on how institutions operate and on the larger culture.




                                                                                     rs
                    My thoughts about the relationship between wokeness and the legal
                system were spelled out in a June 2021 article called “Woke Institutions




                                                                        he
                Is Just Civil Rights Law.” I was surprised to learn just how interesting
                the revelations in the piece were to conservatives, and to anti-­wokes
                more generally. Those who had never been to law school did not know




                                                                      is
                much about government regulations. At the same time, those with a legal
                background often had a superficial understanding of the issues involved




                                                                      bl
                but had not read or thought too deeply about how the law has shaped
                                                          Pu
                the wider culture. On more than one occasion, I have been talking to a
                highly intelligent conservative activist who was shocked when I told him
                that there is an executive order mandating that all large government
                contractors adopt affirmative action programs. The corollary is that
                                                       s

                an executive order could—­at least in theory—­also end such programs.
                                         lin


                Why hasn’t any Republican president even felt pressure from his base to
                undertake such an action, much less actually do it? Well, as it turns out,
                Ronald Reagan wanted to, and the story of how he was stopped, as told
                                ol



                in chapter 6, offers interesting lessons for today’s politics.
                    This book is of more than historical interest. As Friedrich von Hayek
                    rC




                wrote in his preface to The Road to Serfdom, “When a professional stu-
                dent of social affairs writes a political book, his first duty is plainly to
        pe




                say so. This is a political book.”1 My motivation stems from my oppo-
                sition to wokeness and my belief that there is a political path forward
                for those who would like to do something about it. Explaining what this
ar




                path is involves a discussion of at least four things: the exact provisions
                in civil rights law that have led to wokeness; how they have influenced
H




                institutional culture; the mechanisms that can be used to change the
                law; and the political prospects of doing so. This last point is extremely
                important and makes this book unique in the extent to which it hopes to
                be a useful guide for activists, journalists, policymakers, and others who
                dislike where the culture has gone and want to do something about it.

                x                                       Introduction


                   Books arguing about public policy usually focus on the laws or reg-
                ulations their authors would like enacted, while ignoring political reali-
                ties. An underlying theme of this book, however, is that the marketplace
                of ideas is somewhat overrated. While there is a vigorous and seemingly
                evenly matched public debate between intellectuals on the pros and




                                                                                    rs
                cons of wokeness, in institutions the identity-­obsessed left has all the
                power. This is not because they have the most convincing arguments,




                                                                         he
                but because for half a century laws, institutions, and structures have
                helped enforce their ideas about social justice. It would be an act of neg-
                ligence for me to recommend that laws be changed to take away that




                                                                       is
                power without a discussion about the best ways of doing so. Broad social

                                                                       bl
                cess in appointing federal judges, popular anger against wokeness as a

                cultural phenomenon, and the rise of right-­wing media—­put opponents
                of wokeness in a better position to effect change than they have been in
                decades past. A major ambition of this book is to help them realize that.
                   Of course, wokeness has taken on its own momentum largely inde-
                                                    s

                and form private institutions, including media companies, to push back
                against the phenomenon. But politicians, bureaucrats, and lawyers also
                have a major, perhaps preeminent, role to play and should pull the le-

                vers available to them. If they do, they might be surprised by the extent
                of their own power. This book provides the road map to legal reform,
                    rC




                seeing it as a necessary, even if not fully sufficient, step to ultimately
                remaking the culture.

                At its core, what is American politics about? In some democracies, vot-
                ers are clearly divided along lines of region, ethnicity, religion, or class.
                Although such divides clearly exist to a certain extent in the United
                States, the white majority is relatively split between the two major par-

                titudes. If there is one lesson that political scientists have learned over
                the last several decades, it is that American voting behavior is driven by
                cultural and moral values rather than material interests. If you want to

                most prominent activists, media figures, and political leaders on both
                sides, along with the mass of their voters. In 2016, Republicans selected

                much of what had traditionally been the conservative agenda—­because

                tive Political Action Conference (CPAC) was “America Uncanceled.” On
                the other side of the political spectrum, liberal institutions have come
                to speak with one voice on issues of race, gender, and sexual orientation
                as they suppress those who dissent from the dominant worldview. A

                Ponnuru pointed out, Republican voters want to hear their concerns

                stem or reverse cultural trends.

                won eight of thirteen presidential elections. Even when Democrats did

                Jimmy Carter’s most lasting domestic influence was arguably the dereg-

                triangulated on social issues, and declared that “the era of big govern-

                past several decades. Electoral victories have not made conservative
                activists and intellectuals happy or satisfied. Particularly in recent years,
                their rhetoric has trended toward the apocalyptic. In the run-­up to 2016
                Michael Anton wrote an essay called “The Flight 93 Election” for the
                Claremont Review of Books. He argued that, like the doomed passen-

                Trump won the election, yet social liberalism continued its march to the

                apolitical and unlikely to ever be co-­opted by one side of the culture war.

                                                       s

                to enforce that idea, we generally just call them a liberal instead of
                                         lin


                woke. We likewise do not use the term to describe someone who fa-
                vors speech restrictions but only in the form of banning blasphemy and
                pornography—­they are a religious fundamentalist. The third part in-

                volves how wokeness is enforced at an institutional level. It therefore
                does not refer to any particular person’s belief or the content of an ide-

                as necessary to enforce their views.

                   These three pillars are the core of wokeness and sufficient for the
                purposes of this book, although much more can obviously be said. For
                example, the ideology has a standard way to divide people based on

                race, hence unnatural categories like “Asian American Pacific Islander”
                and “Hispanic.” Often, in the interest of overcoming disparities, woke-

                the war on standardized tests, or even the broader concept of merit.
                Moreover, the crusade to overcome gender stereotypes has morphed
                into a questioning of the biological reality of sex, although this prin-
                ciple sits uneasily beside the requirement that the stated identity of a

                sexual orientation and gender identity have become increasingly im-
                portant to wokeness, it is still an open question how long-­lasting these
                debates will be. Controversies over wokeness as related to race and gen-
                der issues can be traced to the “PC wars” of the 1980s and 1990s and,




                                                                                    rs

                sues are relatively new, and although they are increasingly important
                to contemporary wokeness, I will mostly set them aside to focus on the
                core of what has been a long-­standing debate in American society.

                   Each of the three pillars above can be traced to specific government
                policies. While Congress banned “discrimination” based on certain pro-

                tected categories in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it never defined the

                term. That was done later, mostly through executive actions, the un-
                elected bureaucracy, and the courts. Together, these actors decided that
                discrimination did not have to be explicit, or even conscious, and that
                it was a sin committed not against individuals but against “classes” of
                                                       s

                people entitled to pursue class action remedies. It consisted of practices

                having a disparate impact on a protected group, potentially creating le-
                gal liability regardless of intent. And affirmative action was not only not
                banned by the CRA but for all practical purposes required by it. The
                                ol



                doctrine of the “hostile work environment” made comments that were
                rude, condescending, or mean a matter not only of hurt feelings but of
                    rC




                potential tort or regulatory liability if they had racial or sexual conno-
                tations.

                suits, created financial incentives for individuals to develop extremely

                thin skins when it came to sensitive issues. And because all of this has
                been inherently ambiguous about exactly what is or isn’t allowed, we
                have seen the rise of the human resources profession, along with its
                more recent offshoot, the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) indus-
                try, in order to track and enforce the rules. Government got into the

                business of social engineering, while outsourcing much of the enforce-
                ment of its mandates and regulations to the private sector.
                   While the 1964 Civil Rights Act itself was a popular bill passed by
                Congress and signed by the president, therefore giving it democratic
                legitimacy, later innovations mostly came from decisions made by and

                who wrote and voted for it. With a few exceptions, like the Civil Rights
                Act of 1991, a bureaucratic and legal elite made most of the major deci-

                to ancestry. All the while, the general public was at most dimly aware of
                what was happening. To borrow an old economic metaphor, the state
                has been the “invisible hand” molding and shaping institutions toward
                the collection of values that we now identify with the far left.

                neither side of the political spectrum is monolithic, political realities
                ensure that if any politicians adopt the suggestions put forth in this
                book in the coming years, they will be Republicans. I take into account

                Cycles of outrage over institutional wokeness have a certain rhythm.
                Conservatives and centrists might notice, for example, that Google has

                thropology professor is facing an absurd sexual harassment allegation.3
                Stories like this, along with countless others, are treated as signs of the
                triumph of certain ideas. Few will point out that Google is a government
                contractor, and that contractors are regularly required by the Depart-

                reached a settlement with the Department of Education that expanded

                that they all take the same steps because the federal government re-
                quires them to. Yet when major institutions throughout the country all

                is a tendency to treat each one of them as making an independent deci-

                    Intellectuals tend to put a great deal of faith in the importance of
        pe




                ideas. If something has gone wrong, it is often said to be because society
                decided to listen to Philosopher A instead of Philosopher B. It is there-
                fore unsurprising that opponents of wokeness will often trace its rise
ar




                to individuals like Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Herbert Marcuse, or—­in
                the case of the really intellectually ambitious—­Martin Luther. If only

                have happened. Similarly, those who call themselves classical liberals,
                often from within academy, talk about society moving away from the

                principles of tolerance and free speech as if it is simply a matter of
                individuals exchanging one philosophy for another.
                   For example, in The Diversity Myth, originally published in 1995, Da-
                vid Sacks and Peter Thiel saw the switch from the classics to so-­called
                multicultural education at Stanford as a microcosm of what was hap-

                pening to higher education and the rest of society. More recently Helen
                Pluckrose and James Lindsay argue that social justice ideology can be

                traced to postmodern philosophy, which at first “developed in relatively
                obscure corners of academia” and now “has spread to other parts of
                the academy, into activism, throughout bureaucracies, and to the heart




                                                                           is
                of primary, secondary, and post-­secondary education.”6 They contend
                that postmodernism “co-­opted the notion of social justice from the civil




                                                                  bl

                this began “just as legal equality had largely been achieved.” When dis-
                cussing the negative societal effects of the Frankfurt School, Pluckrose
                and Lindsay echo socially conservative thinkers like Pat Buchanan and
                Michael Lind, who conceptualize their opponents as “cultural Marx-

                ists.” Professor Paul Gottfried finds roots that are even deeper, arguing
                                         lin


                that political correctness is a kind of “secular theocracy” and emphasiz-
                ing the “fit between the current state of Protestant Germanic religious
                consciousness and the politics of guilt.”7
                                ol



                   A historical perspective, however, provides many reasons to doubt
                theories that blame any particular philosophy or religion for what has
                    rC




                happened. Wokeness resembles civil rights law more than it does Prot-
                estantism or the writings of any postmodern philosopher, and we can
        pe




                look at the historical and legal record to understand the motivations
                of those who made that law. Pluckrose and Lindsay are mistaken when
                they say that legal equality was achieved in the 1960s. Within just a few
ar




                years after the passing of the Civil Rights Act, the government was
                mandating that employers divide people by race and sex, giving prefer-

                ence to supposedly disadvantaged groups, and even drawing congres-
                sional districts in ways that legitimized tribalism, under the assumption
                that the right to vote wasn’t enough, and that American citizens of cer-
                tain backgrounds could only be adequately represented by members of
                their own race.8 A particular problem for the idea that wokeness came

                In tracing the development of civil rights law over time, we can see that
                it was not created by philosophically inclined liberals who were reading
                Marcuse and Gramsci. The historical record is clear on this point. The

                members of Congress who voted for the Civil Rights Act believed that

                they were dismantling a caste system in the South that was sustained
                by intentional and conscious private and state-­backed discrimination.
                They did not see the bill as a way to remake American society, redistrib-

                   From there, politicians and government bureaucrats in institutions

                like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the

                law and ultimately try to achieve equality of outcome, first for blacks
                and later for other minorities and women.10 Sometimes their motiva-

                well-­organized interest groups.

                cates to compromise, sometimes in ways that appeared to weaken civil
                rights law but ultimately made it a more effective tool of social engineer-
                ing. For example, many liberals within the federal bureaucracy wanted
                to impose racial quotas on industry, which contradicted the plain text

                and original intent of the Civil Rights Act. They instead had to settle for
                standards like disparate impact, which said that any hiring practice that

                presumptively illegal.
                    While this interpretation of the law was no more legally defensible,

                the Supreme Court ultimately signed off on it. Rather than employers
                being allowed simply to fill a quota and otherwise forget about race and




                                                                  bl

                centrist approach to civil rights law seemingly less heavy-­handed but
                culturally more important, as employers had to rethink every aspect of
                their relationship with their employees and the wider public. The irony

                is that if the left had achieved more of a total victory in the 1960s and

                derstood in a similar way. One could imagine a government regula-
                tion that simply banned employees from dating coworkers or made it
                     rC




                against the law to say certain words. Such a course would have been
                politically difficult and likely struck down as unconstitutional. In-
        pe




                stead, the law says that such conduct can violate civil rights law and
                be considered harassment if it is “severe and pervasive.” Nothing is
                explicitly allowed, or prohibited. Employers have little choice but to
ar




                be extremely cautious, while creating bureaucracies and processes that

                    Perhaps the clearest example of an intellectual concept being used as
                a post-­hoc justification for a political compromise that was historically
                contingent can be seen in the rise of the idea of “diversity.” Throughout
                most of the 1960s and 1970s, Americans debated whether there should

                be racial preferences for black Americans. Conservatives argued that
                the law should be color-­blind, while liberals wanted racial balancing in
                order to undo the effects of past discrimination. In University of Cal-
                ifornia v. Bakke (1978), the Supreme Court was bitterly divided on the
                issue. Four justices would have allowed the quota system at the Medical

                down to the opinion of Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who held that while
                quotas were illegal, the Fourteenth Amendment did allow government
                institutions to consider race in the interest of seeking a diverse student

                    Because it ultimately decided the case, Powell’s opinion was the most

                influential on the Court, but it was also the least coherent. The four

                liberal justices pointed out that a system that gives bonus points based
                on race operates in pretty much the same way as a quota system, the
                only real difference being that the former is less honest and therefore
                more politically palatable. The Powell view—­that it was acceptable to

                ter v. Bollinger cases twenty-­five years later. Once again, there was more
                intellectual honesty on both the right and the left than there was in the

                center. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a dissent signed on to by
                other conservatives in Grutter, provided data proving that the Univer-
                    rC




                sity of Michigan was engaging in racial balancing. Justice Ruth Bader
                Ginsburg, in her dissent in Gratz, wrote of the strangeness of banning
        pe




                quotas but being able to reach the same ends “through winks, nods, and
                disguises.”
                    Despite the ad hoc nature of the diversity rationale and the logical in-

                are not, we can see how Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke became official

                decisions before Bakke and finds almost no mention of the benefits of
                diversity in higher education.12 The University of California did not
                even put much emphasis on diversity in the arguments it presented to

                opinion of the California Supreme Court.
                   In the years after the decision, all this changes. The number of news-
                paper articles mentioning diversity in higher education goes from a
                trickle to a flood, as it becomes the standard justification for affirmative

                action policies. We can see the invention of a concept in real time. While
                “diversity” is certainly an idea, it is not one that can claim any kind of

                one judge acting out of either political timidity or intellectual laziness.
                   At its root, the original push for quotas was based on sympathy for

                beyond color-­blindness and adopt policies like affirmative action and

                minority set-­asides in order to buy social peace.14 The sociologist John
                Skrentny agrees, seeing affirmative action as a kind of “crisis manage-

                ment” during a period of mass violence, and shows how moderate black
                leadership was pushed aside through pressure from below in favor of
                a new generation of activists interested in using intimidation to bend
                institutions.15 Some of Tom Wolfe’s works, particularly Mau-­Mauing the
                Flak Catchers, serve to dramatize parts of this dynamic.

                   Whether policies like affirmative action and minority set-­asides are
                actually useful in achieving social peace is beside the point; self-­styled
                “community leaders” often do a good job of convincing politicians and
                bureaucrats that they are. We saw something like this happen in the af-
                termath of the death of George Floyd, where the more communities ri-

                oted, the more convinced institutions became that they had to listen to
                activists who could claim to speak for them.




                                                                             he
                   The historical record reveals that wokeness can be understood as a
                series of political compromises. Some, like the Bakke decision, while in-
                tellectually incoherent, are sufficiently successful in obscuring what is




                                                                           is
                being done that the political salience of the relevant policy is lowered.
                This means diversity initiatives but not quotas, and vague sexual ha-

                would be more of an explicit repudiation of traditional American free-
                doms. Instead of policies with clear justifications, guidance, and goals,
                the law comes to act as a sort of ethical scold that is responsive to mass
                panics and evolving ideas about nondiscrimination and equality that

                the rationale of “diversity” required the creation of a new and largely in-
                coherent official ideology that has been used to justify crusades against
        pe




                “inequity” and constant management of the thoughts and behaviors of
                students and faculty. Only after this process is complete and the initial
                rationale is set—­in this case by judicial fiat—­do we see the intellectual

                   In addition to the historical record, there is another reason to doubt
                that wokeness is the product of philosophical currents with deep roots
                in American history or Western culture. As critics point out, many of
                the opinions educated people feel coerced to accept are not even con-
                sistent, let alone representative of any particular philosophy. Whenever

                there is a lucrative profession that attracts a disproportionate number
                of men, the only socially acceptable—­in some cases, the only legally
                permissible—­view is that women are being discriminated against, if
                they happen to find themselves in the field, or are somehow discouraged
                from entering the field in the first place. Entire academic disciplines

                based on social conditioning.17 What are we to make, then, of the sudden




                                                                          he
                triumph of the view that trans identity is an immutable characteristic,
                meaning that individuals born with XY chromosomes can “know” that
                they are women, often by citing evidence like a desire to wear dresses




                                                                        is
                and play with dolls as a child? At the same time, when a biological female
                feels the urge to do those exact same things, we look for social, rather




                                                                  bl
                than genetic, causes of said behavior.   Pu
                   Similarly, we can understand that sex was included in the Civil Rights
                Act as a protected category for very strange and idiosyncratic reasons,
                placed in the bill through the machinations of a southern segregationist
                in the hopes of killing it. Nonetheless, within a few years, feminist ac-

                tivists were pushing for the executive branch to take the prohibition on
                                         lin


                sex discrimination as seriously as it took discrimination against blacks.
                Now as then, feminist activists have tended to be disproportionately
                career-­focused, meaning they were the ones who determined the kind
                                ol



                of “womanhood” that the law would cultivate and protect. To some,
                blank-­slate notions of gender were appealing, as such ideas validated
                     rC




                their own choices and inclinations. The fact that feminist and LGBT
                dogma contradict each other is a problem for logicians and political phi-
        pe




                losophers but not for the law or the psychology of true believers. Woke-
                ness is rooted in neither a blank-­slate view of human nature nor genetic
                determinism. It can force individuals to adopt one perspective on one
ar




                issue and the opposite on another, as when a reporter for the Daily Caller
                asked members of the Congressional Black Caucus why men tended to

                be arrested for crimes at higher rates than women, and two of them
                cited biological realities and group differences in behavior.18
                   Gender ideology is only the most absurd and extreme example of the
                contradictions of wokeness. It inspires a backlash because it reaches a
                point where the reigning ideology goes too far even for “Havel’s green-

                   The ideas associated with wokeness did not win in a marketplace of

                ideas. In many cases, it almost gives them too much credit to even con-
                sider them ideas in the first place. All of the contradictions noted above
                    rC




                can be explained by understanding wokeness as the name we give to a
                collection of beliefs that one must hold for legal and psychosocial rea-

                sons, without any mechanism to ensure logical consistency built into
                the system. We do not look for logical consistency in an act of Congress

                   Like an act of Congress, wokeness can similarly be seen as a “log-
                rolled” set of cultural beliefs. Individuals and organizations that claim to
                speak for some identity group complain and make certain demands for

                getting all of what they want, but politicians, bureaucrats, and institu-
                tions find ways to pacify them without inspiring too much of a back-
                lash by making what is happening too clear or explicit. This involves

                planation for wokeness relies on a conceptual mistake, likely rooted in
                the need of intellectuals to exaggerate their importance. One is today
                supposed to believe a list of things about race, gender, and sexual orien-
                tation that are consistent with one another in some ways but not others.

                practices should be seen less as a philosophical doctrine with its own
                impeccable inner logic than as a political program that has emerged
                                ol



                from a combination of factors such as interest group lobbying, mass
                emotional sentiment, and bureaucrats seeking to increase their power.

                   Understanding the role of the state can explain much of what is

                growing concerns about racism against Chinese Americans in the midst
                of the Covid-19 pandemic, why did we speak about hatred against “Asian

ar




                any attacks against Samoans? Why do we worry about disparities in ar-
                rests and school achievement between “Hispanics” and “whites” but
H




                not between Swedes and Italians or Puerto Ricans and Arabs? Why, de-
                spite a war on terror that led to the victimization of Muslims both at
                home and abroad, do we see so little organized political activity among
                Muslim Americans relative to politicians and activists who identify with
                artificial categories like Hispanics and AAPI?

                    The wokeness-­as-­law perspective can help one understand all of this
                and much else.
                    The question of whether wokeness is understood more as a political
                or philosophical phenomenon is of more than historical interest. How
                we answer it determines how one pushes back. If it is a matter of phi-

                losophy and belief, then the answer is more books, articles, essays, and
                scientific studies debunking the beliefs that form the basis of identity

                politics and political correctness. In other words, keep employing the
                same strategy that opponents of earlier and more contemporary forms
                of wokeness have used since at least the 1970s, when disillusioned for-

                The state decides what counts as correct doctrine, forces institutions

                This does not mean that the state is irrelevant; during periods in which
                religiosity is on the rise, we can still reasonably say that the legal regime
        pe




                is in part responsible. We would be especially likely to give credence to

                things worse.31 This book goes further than most in its perspective on

                how disastrous the downstream effects of policies meant to reduce in-
                equality between designated groups have been.
                   The first unique contribution of this work is in explaining how we
                got to our current cultural moment, through a focus on legal structures
                and practical politics rather than philosophy. The opening chapters of




                                                                                   rs

                icans celebrate the triumph of left-­wing ideas on race and gender once
                relegated to the fringes of the academy, while others denounce it. Yet
                each side has an interest in understanding how we got here, and the

                   Second, this book seeks to provide a plan for how those opposed to

                wokeness can reverse its effects. The story of how we moved from the
                Civil Rights Act of 1964, a bill that is on its face race-­neutral and only
                concerned with explicit discrimination, to practically all major institu-
                tions being dominated by wokeness, is one of path dependency and un-

                intended consequences. This provides those on the right with practical

                steps they can take to return to a world in which they at least have a
                chance in the culture wars. It offers a path back toward a society that
                places more emphasis on merit and free speech, and less on achieving
                                ol



                equality between groups. It shows how, by changing or repealing a few
                laws, one can foster diversity across institutions, instead of using race-­
                     rC




                and sex-­consciousness to promote diversity within institutions, which
                ironically leads to their homogenization.

                   How would the policy recommendations argued for in this book ulti-

                cus on disparities in outcomes, and toward objective standards of merit

                and an ideal of equal treatment? What would the downstream effects
                be on the larger society? While it would be naive to think that revers-
H




                ing the excesses of civil rights law would change the culture overnight,
                what our politics can do is give less control to left-­wing bureaucrats and
                allow markets and individual preferences to have more of a say in how
                institutions evolve.
                   For established institutions that have gone all in on the new faith,

                particularly colleges and universities, there are likely limits to what can
                be done. Coca-­Cola and Microsoft will continue to be woke, and govern-
                ment policy is unlikely to make much of a difference. The hope is that
                the next generation of successful entrepreneurs and the institutions
                they build are molded in a legal environment that is more politically

                neutral. We see hints of what may come in the rise of corporations, like
                Coinbase, Substack, and Basecamp, that are explicitly disavowing politi-




                                                                             he
                cal activism, even in the absence of any changes in civil rights law. There
                will be no V-­Day in the war on wokeness; rather, those outraged by cur-
                rent trends should try to change laws today in the hopes of creating a

                cultural battles of the present are forgotten.

        pe




                of legal analysis. In 1995, when Sen. Bob Dole asked the Congressional
                Research Service for a report on federal programs that use racial and
                ethnic criteria, it came back with 160 of them.32 This book focuses on

                the most important doctrines that have been used for the purposes of
                social engineering, and encourages those who are anti-­woke to priori-

                tize new laws, regulations, and judicial decisions that can have the most
                far-­reaching impact on undoing the damage.
                   Wokeness in its current form was not explicitly created at the top
                and forced on every firm; rather, anti-­discrimination laws as invented
                and interpreted by bureaucrats, lawyers, and judges created incentives

                year.34 Moreover, the rate of turnover appears to be accelerating, with
                S&P 500 companies in 1965 having had more staying power than those

                On February 8, 1964, as Congress debated what would become the Civil
                Rights Act, Rep. Howard Smith (D-­VA) introduced an amendment to
                the bill. As proposed, the law prohibited discrimination based on race,
                color, religion, and national origin in employment. In an attempt to kill
                                                    s

                the bill, Rep. Smith proposed including sex as a protected category. In
                                         lin


                explaining why, he claimed to have received a letter from “a lady” who
                was upset that the country had too many women relative to men, mean-
                ing that many “spinsters,” he said she’d written, were deprived of “the
                                ol



                ‘right’ of every female to have a husband.” Amid laughter, he assured
                the House of Representatives that “she has her statistics, which is the
                    rC




                reason why I am reading it to you, because this is serious.”1
                    Despite Rep. Smith’s intentions, the amendment passed, as did the
        pe




                Civil Rights Act. In its early years, the newly formed EEOC had no idea
                what to do with the ban on sex discrimination, a concept that seemed
                fanciful in the mid-1960s. Its first executive director in 1966 called the
ar




                provision a “fluke” that was “conceived out of wedlock,” asserting that
                “men are entitled to female secretaries.”2 The EEOC was initially unsure
H




                whether the Civil Rights Act even prohibited protective legislation at
                the state level, which banned women from certain professions or lim-
                ited their hours.3 But due to pressure both from within and outside gov-
                ernment, things soon began to change radically, and by the early 1970s,
                feminism in something resembling its current form had triumphed

                within the federal bureaucracy. In 2020, the ban on sex discrimination—­
                passed at a time when homosexuality and transgenderism were widely
                believed to be forms of social deviance—­was relied on by the Supreme
                Court in Bostock v. Clayton County to rule that discrimination based on
                sexual orientation or gender identity was also prohibited. The story of




                                                                                        rs
                how sex discrimination became illegal, and how the definition of “dis-
                crimination” changed over time, tells us something fundamental about




                                                                           he

                and courts interpret the law. But in the hands of bureaucrats, executive
                agencies, and judges, the text can take on a life of its own.




                                                                  bl

                ident Johnson would ultimately force police departments to lower their
                physical fitness standards to accommodate women, much less make em-
                ployers subscribe to theories about the malleability and subjectivity of

                has little to do with the values and beliefs of American society in 1964.
                The debate that culminated in the CRA was about the misfortunes of
                black people in the South, and even that resulted in a compromise that
                                ol



                mandated equal treatment in the private and public sectors.
                   No one in American society thought that Congress was in the pro-
                    rC




                cess of creating an open-­ended and indefinite commitment to achiev-
                ing equality between various groups. Between 1940 and 1972, the New
        pe




                York Times reported on 3,800 demonstrations in favor of civil rights,
                of which 95 percent were in relation to discrimination against African
                Americans.4 One analysis shows sixty-­nine instances of representatives

                for black organizations testifying before Congress in civil rights hear-
                ings between 1940 and 1972, compared to two for all other races, and
H




                nine for any national origins group.5 When President Johnson signed the
                Civil Rights Act, he only mentioned discrimination based on race and
                color. The first annual report from the EEOC, released in 1966, stated
                plainly that “the chief thrust of the statute was, of course, aimed at dis-
                crimination against the Negro.”6

                30                                The Origins of Woke


                   The federal government has not only interpreted the CRA in ways
                that Congress could not have foreseen. In some ways, its interpretations
                have directly contradicted what legislators promised and agreed to. In
                his opening statement in the debate over the bill, Sen. Hubert Hum-
                phrey told fellow legislators that there was no chance that it would lead




                                                                                            rs
                to reverse discrimination.7




                                                                            he
                     That bugaboo has been brought up a dozen times: but it is nonexistent.
                     In fact, the very opposite is true. Title VII prohibits discrimination. In
                     effect, it says that race, religion, and national origin are not to be used




                                                                          is
                     as the basis for hiring and firing.




                                                                   bl
                   Further emphasizing the point, the future vice president told a skep-
                                                           Pu
                tical colleague that if he could find “any language which provides that an
                employer will have to hire on the basis of percentage or quota related to
                color . . . I will start eating the pages.” Yet Congress wasn’t satisfied with
                such assurances. So the following text was also added to the bill:
                                                    s
                                         lin


                     Nothing contained in this title shall be interpreted to require any [em-
                     ployer or labor union] to grant preferential treatment to any individual
                     or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or national ori-
                                   ol



                     gin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance which may
                     rC




                     exist . . .


                   The text of the document and the legislative history agree on this
        pe




                point. Yet ultimately none of this would matter, and it would be used to
                justify proportional hiring by race and sex. In 1968, Clifford Alexander,
                the director of the EEOC, declared, “Our most valid standard is in num-
ar




                bers . . . The only accomplishment is when we look at all those numbers
                and see a vast improvement in the picture.”8 A few years later, a Labor
H




                Department official would explain requirements for government con-
                tractors by saying that “affirmative action is anything you have to do to
                get results.”9
                   Congress would pass other bills, including the Equal Employment
                Opportunity Act (EEOA) of 1972 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, that

                would be more friendly to race-­conscious remedies for past discrimina-
                tion. But it never explicitly endorsed the main innovations of civil rights
                law. The Supreme Court—­engaging in the kind of sophistry that has be-

                what was or wasn’t allowed in 1964, but ultimately text on paper passed

                The first is the text of legislation itself, which can be seen as the holy
                book. While technically it is the highest authority one can appeal to,
                religious books are often vague and self-­contradictory. They are not up-
                dated to account for changes in the real world. Even when a participant

                    At the second level is the priestly class that interprets the faith. Un-

                respond to later historical and cultural circumstances, and have wide dis-

                civil rights lawyers, bureaucrats, and judges. But there are additional in-

                at lower levels, individuals like HR professionals, school administrators,
                and others who might be considered part of the “managerial class.” This
                is where one finds the major innovations in civil rights law.

                    Finally, there is the community of religious believers who, by relying
                on the priestly class, interpret the faith in ways consistent with pragma-

                tism and local conditions. This can be analogized to folk understanding
                of what the state of the law is. For example, about a quarter of Amer-
                icans believe that hate speech is illegal, which is not technically true;
                but it can be seen as an understandable mistake, given the state of anti-­
                harassment law.10

                    The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the culmination of a moral strug-
                gle that had helped define the United States since its founding. Debates
                over slavery almost derailed the adoption of the Constitution and led
                to a series of compromises among the founding generation: the three-­
                fifths rule; a prohibition on Congress banning the slave trade until 1808;




                                                                                    rs
                and the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution. After the Civil War,
                the main question of American politics centered around what to do with




                                                                          he
                newly emancipated slaves. Reconstruction, an attempt to use federal
                power to force racial equality onto the old Confederacy, ended in the
                aftermath of the election of 1876, through a congressional compromise




                                                                        is
                that elevated Rutherford B. Hayes to the presidency. After that, ques-
                tions centered around the relationship between black Americans and




                                                                  bl
                the rest of society were generally treated as settled and a relatively mi-

                    What changed in the mid-­twentieth century? It would be surprising if
                the rise of television did not play a role, as it both nationalized politics
                and provided footage that increased sympathy for the plight of black

                southerners. In 1950, only 9 percent of American homes had a televi-

                sion. This number rose to 65 percent in 1955, and 87 percent in 1960.11 In
                the words of historian Rick Perlstein, writing on the power of the broad-
                cast networks, “TV news styled itself a moral center of American civic

                life . . . It was their footage of Bull Connor’s fire hoses in Birmingham
                that catalyzed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, their footage at the Edmund
                     rC




                Pettus Bridge that brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965.”12
                    With the passage of these laws and others during the Johnson ad-
        pe




                ministration, most Americans believed their elected officials were re-
                sponding to a specific problem in one area of the country. They were
                not convinced of the need for an open-­ended commitment that would

                tween blacks and whites, much less whites and other groups, or men

                and women. Nonetheless, in the words of Nathan Glazer, soon after
                Congress prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, or
                national origin, “we then began an extensive effort to record the race,
                color, and (some) national origins of just about every student and em-
                ployee and recipient of government benefits or services in the nation;

                given groups; and school systems to assign their children on the basis
                of their race, color, and (some) national origins.”13 This is not what the
                country signed up for, and it certainly did not believe that government
                had been given a mandate to regulate humor and dating, nor reach into

                   This chapter addresses the four great innovations in civil rights law:
                federally mandated affirmative action, disparate impact, harassment

                the professional and personal lives of students and those employed by
                schools and universities. In the case of disparate impact, the doctrine
                makes practically everything potentially illegal. It gives government dis-

                chapter, which discusses how these doctrines have given rise to bureau-
                cracies that suppress speech, regulate conduct, and enforce adherence

                In theory, executive orders, which are signed by the president, are fed-
                eral directives on how an existing law will be interpreted and enforced.
                In practice, they often make law, just as judicial decisions do. The exec-
ar




                utive branch has long used its contracting power to regulate business in
                ways that would require legislation if applied to non-­contractors. Con-

                sign and enforce the contracts to carry out government functions, and
                this has given the latter leverage over the private sector.
                   The first modern EO on equal opportunity in federal contracting
                was signed by President Roosevelt in June 1941, just months before the

                agencies, along with unions and companies engaged in war-­related work.
                Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy in EO 10925 required gov-
                ernment contractors with business beyond a minimum threshold to
                “take affirmative action” to ensure nondiscrimination in employment

                after the CRA was passed, President Johnson signed EO 11246, which, as
                amended throughout the years, has become the basis of the modern af-
                firmative action in contracting regime. It created what would come to be

                called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP),
                located within the Labor Department. In 1967, Johnson added “sex” to

                    While Johnson originally signed EO 11246, it was the Nixon adminis-
                tration that ironically created the affirmative action regime we see to-
                day, over the resistance of a bipartisan coalition in Congress. Under the
                                                    s

                Labor Department, the administration began by forcing affirmative ac-

                tion on construction workers, first in Philadelphia, and then nationwide.
                This was followed up in 1971 by Revised Order No. 4, which expanded
                the regulations beyond the construction industry to all contractors and

                    The ultimate authority of the executive branch to legally mandate
                affirmative action among contractors is unclear. A 1969 memo from At-
                torney General John Mitchell mentioned the Civil Rights Act but mostly
ar




                relied on the president’s constitutional authority.15 A decade later, the
                Supreme Court mentioned two other statutes as potential sources of

                executive power in this area.16 While it may seem strange to non-­lawyers
                that there is such a high degree of uncertainty about the legal justifica-
                tion for regulations that have done so much to remake the American
                workplace, this is only one of the many contradictions and paradoxes

                often not even that.
                   Nonetheless, while its legal basis is murky, there is much less doubt
                about the reach of EO 11246 and its successor documents. Because of

                workforce, generally, will reflect the gender, racial and ethnic profile
                of the labor pools from which the contractor recruits and selects.”19 If

                contractor must break his business down into “organizational units,”
                and record the race, gender, and ethnicity of the supervisor of each
                one. Within each unit, the business must record the number of males
                and females of each of the following groups: blacks, Hispanics, Asians/

                in a “workforce analysis,” which divides the employees of a company by

                job title. Those with titles that are similar in terms of work and pay are
                combined into “job groups.”




                                                                  bl

                means comparing the number of women and minorities in each job group
                to their estimated availability in the population. And how does one de-
                termine availability? By coming up with a number for the “percentage of
                minorities or women with requisite skills in the reasonable recruitment

                                         lin


                the employer must create “placement goals” to correct its deficiency.
                    This system is bizarre in several respects. Instead of the government
                mandating a number of women and minorities to be hired in a given job,
                                ol



                it leaves the employer to engage in a series of subjective analyses and
                set goals and timetables for itself. The contractor has discretion regard-
                     rC




                ing how it classifies its employees into job groups and to some extent
                how it decides to place them with regard to the four “minority groups.”
        pe




                The “availability analysis” itself is particularly absurd, as it would be a
                challenge for a team of social scientists to determine how many women
                and minorities in a particular area are qualified for each job category.

                How business owners and corporations should be reasonably expected
                to do so is never adequately explained. One is advised to consult “cen-
H




                sus data, data from local job service offices, and data from colleges or
                other training institutions.” The contractor is warned, however, that it
                cannot define “reasonable recruitment area” in a way “to have the effect
                of excluding minorities or women.”
                    Every aspect of employers’ analysis is reviewable by government bu-

                reaucrats. For the same reason that a contractor can always get around
                affirmative action requirements, the government can always find
                grounds to apply pressure on a business. From the contractor’s perspec-
                tive, all they can know for certain is that they must go through the mo-
                tions, and that hiring and promoting more minorities and women will

                    At the same time, businesses are told that “quotas are expressly for-

                bidden.” Incredibly, we are to believe that placement goals as they are
                intended to be used “do not create set-­asides for specific groups, nor are
                they intended to achieve proportional representation or equal results.”




                                                                         is
                Somehow, sentences like this are found in the exact same regulations
                requiring placement goals based on nothing more than disparities in




                                                                  bl
                representation. Quite simply, businesses need to classify their employ-

                ees, and in many cases engage in reverse discrimination, though they are
                prohibited from being too explicit about it. As Edward C. Sylvester, the
                first director (1965–1968) of what became the OFCCP, said in a state-
                ment to businessmen, “Affirmative action is anything you have to do to
                                                    s

                get results. But this does not necessarily include preferential treatment.
                                         lin


                The key word here is ‘results.’ ”21 “Results” but not “quotas.” This pre-
                sumes that there is always a way to get results by neutral and objective
                methods, an idea that there has never been the slightest bit of evidence
                                ol



                for, which is of course why government regulations mandate that busi-
                nesses take into account race and sex in the first place. Politicians have
                    rC




                played the same game. As one historian wrote about the thirty-­seventh
                president, “The affirmative action measures Nixon adopted were goals;
        pe




                those he rejected were quotas.”22
                    Places of business must broadcast this doublethink to the world, an-
                nouncing themselves as “equal opportunity employers,” which means
ar




                that decisions are made without discriminating based on protected cat-
                egories. No reader should make the mistake of believing that the de-
H




                tailed and dense nature of Labor Department regulations means that
                they are logically coherent or adhere to basic principles of the rule of
                law. Rather, they make a soft quota system politically and legally palat-
                able while giving regulators arbitrary power over business as they pre-
                tend to restrain themselves.

                   The result is not simply that the contractor works toward numer-
                ical goals and treats some employees differently than others. To do
                business with the federal government, one must participate in rituals
                that both legitimize the goals of the state while hiding the nature of
                the project. Among the requirements placed on employers is one to




                                                                                       rs

                are to be recorded and classified according to sex and government race
                categories. Each business must be aware of the racial dynamics in its
                own community, forcing the private sector into the dishonest project of




                                                                        is
                creating identity-­obsessed institutions that simultaneously champion

                   Sociologists and anthropologists have noted the role that ritual plays

                in legitimizing religious, social, and political orders. Some definitions
                even focus on ritual as the defining feature of religion, as opposed to
                what individuals truly believe. Government contract compliance serves
                this purpose when it forces the private sector to express agreement with

                deeply rooted in the beliefs of individuals and therefore indestructible

                or even using the same exact words and phrases that the government
                forces them to repeat in order to remain in good standing.

                   In Vaclav Havel’s famous story about the greengrocer that mouths
                communist propaganda, a shop owner displays an official message to
        pe




                communicate to the world that he is the type of person who wants to
                live a quiet life and be left alone.23 But the message cannot explicitly state
                this, for his sense of dignity will not allow him to publicly announce his
ar




                cowardice to the world. The obfuscatory nature of affirmative action
                regulations plays a similar role. Americans believe in equal opportunity

                and treating people as individuals. Few Americans want to devote their
                lives to institutions that openly discriminate against their fellow citi-
                zens. Instead of making individuals refute widely held principles and
                directly face the fact that they must adopt identity-­based preferences in

                is about as clear as it can possibly be regarding what the authors of the
                bill meant. Time and again, members of Congress foresaw the possibil-
                ity that Title VII could be used to push for a disparate impact standard
                or equality of outcomes, and it is difficult to imagine how they could
                have made themselves clearer that such interpretations were forbidden.

                was passing, and how judges and bureaucrats would ignore its wishes
                anyway, raises serious questions about who ultimately has the power to
                make law under our system of government.

                critics of the bill expressed concern that it might do x. In response, sup-

                agree to a compromise that involved entering a clause into the bill in

                                                                  bl

                will.”25 For example, the law included a provision that protected senior-
                ity systems that had existed before the bill was passed, meaning that the
                new law was not supposed to be retrospective, but simply stop discrimi-
                nation in the future. Within a few years, old collective bargaining agree-

                racial inequality in place. The most harmful interpretation of the Civil
                Rights Act, however, would ultimately be the disparate impact standard.
                As the bill was being debated, an anti-­discrimination state commission
                                ol



                in Illinois held Motorola to be acting in an unfair manner because it gave
                an aptitude test that disproportionately screened out blacks. The result

                in Washington was outrage across the political spectrum. Sen. John
                Tower (R-­TX) was therefore able to insert Section 703(h) into Title VII.
        pe




                This provision allowed employers to make use of “any professionally de-
                veloped ability test,” as long as it was not “designed, intended, or used”
                to discriminate.26

                   The testing provision was only a specific articulation of a more gen-
                eral principle. Members of Congress were unanimous in saying that
H




                quotas were discriminatory and that preferential treatment, even of the
                “reverse discrimination” kind, was not allowed, and therefore of course
                not mandatory. Hubert Humphrey’s promise to eat the bill if it required
                quotas is perhaps the most famous of the assurances given. But others
                were just as clear. In April 1964, Sen. Joseph P. Clark (D-­PA) and Sen.

                Clifford P. Case (R-­NJ), the floor managers of the bill, submitted a joint
                memorandum to clarify that there would be no reverse discrimination
                or disparate impact standard. Not only would Title VII not require racial
                balancing, but it would explicitly forbid it. Even if there were a job qual-
                ification where, “because of differences in background and education,”




                                                                                      rs
                some groups performed better than others, Title VII would do nothing
                to make it illegal. According to the memorandum, “an employer may




                                                                           he
                set his qualifications as high as he likes . . . and he may hire, assign, and
                promote on the basis of test performance.” Sen. Harrison A. Williams
                (D-­NJ) put it even more bluntly when he declared that “an employer




                                                                         is
                with only white employees could continue to have only the best quali-
                fied persons even if they were all white.”27




                                                                  bl
                    Despite all this, in 1968, the EEOC commissioner would say that
                                                        Pu
                “our most valid standard is numbers . . . The only accomplishment
                is when we look at all those numbers and see a vast improvement in
                the picture.”28 The Supreme Court sanctioned this approach in Griggs
                v. Duke Power Co. (1971), which ruled that intelligence tests on which
                                                    s

                blacks scored lower than whites could not be used in hiring without
                                         lin


                creating a presumption that the employer was discriminating based on
                race. The new doctrine of disparate impact did not require any discrim-
                inatory intent on the part of a firm. As long as something the firm did
                                ol



                benefited one group at the expense of another, it could potentially face
                legal liability. The Griggs decision allowed for an employer to defend it-
                    rC




                self by pointing to “business necessity.” In practice, however, the EEOC
                took this to mean that employers would have to engage in expensive val-
        pe




                idation procedures for a test to be allowed, and the agency put up other
                hurdles, such as requiring that tests be shown to be predictive for every
                particular minority group, every single job within an organization, and
ar




                for the same job across different institutions.29 A Department of Justice
                (DOJ) memorandum in 1976 noted that the rules had made practically
H




                every employer that used tests potentially noncompliant, and busi-
                nesses were therefore engaging in numerical hiring to achieve racial bal-
                ance. Observers made the reasonable assumption that the goal of EEOC
                regulations was to make standardized tests as difficult as possible to use,
                in order to push employers toward hiring and promotion procedures

                for women and minorities.
                   The outrageousness of Griggs can be seen in the fact that even those
                who have supported preferential treatment for blacks have acknowl-
                edged that there is little support for their favored policy in either the

                text of the Civil Rights Act or the congressional record. The EEOC it-
                self urged the NAACP not to appeal its limited victory in the Fourth




                                                                          he
                Circuit in Griggs because the test in question was of the exact type the
                statute sought to protect in 1964.30 Just two years before the decision,
                the EEOC had published an official history in which it admitted that the




                                                                        is
                common understanding of Title VII was that discrimination required
                intent on the part of the employer. Once its preferred interpretation




                                                                  bl
                of the law was reviewed by the judiciary, it predicted that “the Com-

                mission and the courts will be in disagreement.” Nonetheless, the year
                after Griggs, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act brought state and
                local employment under the power of the EEOC, thus applying the dis-
                parate impact standard in those contexts too. The law also consolidated
                                                    s

                   Ironically, by being concerned with unintentional discrimination
                against certain “protected” groups, disparate impact doctrine requires
                                ol



                intentional discrimination against others. An employer who wants to
                use intelligence tests to hire is potentially barred from doing so because
                     rC




                whites could do too well. He must make a conscious decision to pick a
                hiring practice that guarantees fewer white people, in order to avoid one
        pe




                that has a disparate impact against blacks. Griggs, therefore, diverges
                from the original intent of the Civil Rights Act in two ways, both ex-
                panding the definition of what counts as “discrimination” when it comes
ar




                to women and minorities, and by necessity therefore giving whites and
                men less protection than Congress thought it was providing them.
H




                   When faced with undeniable evidence in the plain text of the law and
                historical record, judges have appealed to the higher purpose of the stat-
                ute. By passing the Civil Rights Act, Congress meant to help black people,
                so the “purpose” of the law can supposedly allow disparate treatment
                by race in order to achieve equal results. An unusually honest opinion

                v. Weber (1979). In that case, the Labor Department had forced a quota
                system onto a contractor and the labor union it worked with, requiring
                that half of new positions in a program to train skilled craftsmen go to
                blacks. A white employee filed a class action lawsuit on the grounds that

                he and others of his race had been discriminated against under Title VII.
                    The case thus forced the Supreme Court to address the contradiction




                                                                           he
                between affirmative action requirements placed on government con-
                tractors, which were explicitly geared toward achieving racial balance,

                individuals. Justice Blackmun signed on to the 5–2 decision authorizing
                reverse discrimination even though, in his concurrence, he agreed with




                                                                  bl
                the dissent that “the Congress that passed Title VII probably thought
                                                        Pu
                it was adopting a principle of nondiscrimination that would apply to
                blacks and whites alike.” Nonetheless, he decided that allowing prefer-
                ences in favor of blacks—­in this case with government encouragement
                through the Labor Department—­should be allowed for reasons he called
                                                    s

                “practical and equitable.”

                    If this sounds like a judge making up the law to fit his own political
                preference, that is because that is exactly what it is. At the very least,
                Justice Blackmun should be credited for his candor. But to appeal to
                                ol



                the purpose of a statute to contradict its plain text is to nullify the bar-
                gain that Congress ultimately arrived at. Yes, the Civil Rights Act was
                    rC




                meant to improve the condition of black people. But that goal was to
                be balanced against concerns of individual liberty, economic freedom,
        pe




                federalism, and the principle that nobody—­including whites—­should
                be discriminated against on account of their race.
                    Laws are not supposed to be blank checks for courts and bureaucrats
ar




                to seek out their preferred policy outcomes. Alfred Blumrosen, an of-
                ficial who worked for the EEOC in its early days, wrote with unusual
H




                candor about how the agency sought to get around the plain meaning of
                the law, as he and his allies preferred to see civil rights statutes more as
                broad “charters for equality” than explicit rules about what government
                can and cannot do.32
                    In a narrow sense, Griggs was about written tests used in the private

                ment employment, government-­funded institutions, and practices other
                than written exams. Title VI bans discrimination under any program that
                receives financial assistance from the federal government. In Alexander
                v. Sandoval (2001), the Court ruled that Title VI banned intentional dis-

                crimination, yet left open the question of whether its rules also prohibit
                disparate impact, while also holding that it did not create a private cause




                                                                          he
                of action in the latter kind of case. What this means in practice is that
                the disparate impact standard in federally funded institutions is—­while
                legally controversial and perhaps soon to be found inconsistent with the

                all schools and universities. Given what was done with Title VII, it is not
                surprising to learn that Title VI has made disparate impact a standard
                woven into private institutions and American governance at all levels.
                    This is why the Obama administration went out of its way to harass

                to enforce this invented right.34 One result of applying Title VII to gov-
                ernment employment has been that states and localities hiring police,
        pe




                firefighters, and correctional officers are now forced to lower physical

                fortable at work—­has developed to ensure that business owners must

                der federal law. The first major court case to recognize a cause of ra-
                cial harassment was Rogers v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
                (1971), decided by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. A Hispanic woman
                                ol



                in Texas working for an optometrist claimed, among other things, that
                her employer used different colors of ink to take the appointments of
                    rC




                black and white patients. The employer resisted this particular part of
                the resulting EEOC inquiry on the grounds that it had nothing to do
        pe




                with an allegation made under Title VII; at most, the practice would
                indicate discrimination against patients, which was not under the juris-
                diction of the body.

                   By a 2–1 decision, the Fifth Circuit disagreed. The opinion, by Judge
                Irving L. Goldberg, held that discrimination against black customers

                could contribute to an environment in which a Hispanic employee could
                feel discriminated against. The court discerned in the statutory language
                of the Civil Rights Act “a Congressional intention to define discrimina-
                tion in the broadest possible terms,” which showed an acknowledgment
                “that constant change is the order of our day and that the seemingly

                the morrow.” A mere seven years after the signing of the bill, this now
                meant that the law mandated the elimination of “working environments
                so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the
                emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers.”




                                                                                     rs
                   As with everything in civil rights law, courts and bureaucrats were
                quicker to act to expand the definition of “harassment” based on race

                than they were for sex. When it came to preventing the harassment of
                women, they started with the most egregious and least sympathetic con-
                duct before then moving on and eventually reaching a point where there

                bidden. In early sex discrimination cases, courts found that a boss could

                Rights Act, based on the logic that it was the physical attraction to an
                employee or applicant, not her sex per se, that motivated the conduct.37
                   This changed with the 1977 case of Barnes v. Costle. A female employee
                working for the EPA claimed that her supervisor repeatedly proposi-
                                                    s

                tioned and eventually fired her for rejecting his advances. The DC Cir-
                                         lin


                cuit ruled that this was a violation of the law: “but for her womanhood,
                from aught that appears, her participation in sexual activity would never
                have been solicited.” The degree to which one has to stretch the mean-
                                ol



                ing of Title VII to find this result is shown in footnote 55 of the opinion:
                there the Court says that if a supervisor or employer is bisexual, insist-
                     rC




                ing on sexual favors does not qualify as sexual harassment under the
                logic of the decision. Left unanswered is whether it would violate civil
        pe




                rights law if the bisexual employer was attracted to, say, thin women but
                only fat men, thus treating the sexes differently.
                   Had this been as far as the courts and federal bureaucracy were
ar




                willing to go, there may have been little to complain about, no matter
                how badly reasoned we consider such interpretations of the law. Yet
H




                simply forbidding the demanding of sexual favors, like only attacking
                intentional discrimination, did not go far enough for those motivated
                by profit and self-­righteousness and operating far outside of the view
                of democratic processes. In 1979, law professor Catharine MacKinnon

                in around one in 50 million n-­grams (two-­word phrases, in this case),
                according to the Google Ngram viewer. By its peak in the mid-1990s, it
                was at about one in every 200,000.

                rassment cases could be filed as class actions (Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite
                Co., Eighth Circuit, 1997); employers could be held responsible for the

                cided that behavior is a violation of Title VII when it is “severe or per-

                sions at the state and federal levels that have found in constitutionally
                protected speech evidence of a hostile work environment: signs with the

                person; misogynistic rap music; and circulating offensive jokes and an

                isolated remarks or actions illegal, Volokh points out that the only plau-
                sible way for employers to be sure they are following the law is to restrict
                speech that could potentially be used as evidence of discrimination.
                Imagine a manager hearing about a single incident in which a worker is
                offended. Based on the guidance provided by regulators and the courts,




                                                                                      rs
                such an action is not necessarily against the law in isolation, but is po-
                tentially illegal if it is part of a larger pattern. How can an employer thus




                                                                          he
                create a rule that tells employees that they have the right to speak freely
                on controversial topics or display certain imagery, but only if other em-
                ployees are not engaging in similar conduct beyond a certain undefined

                threshold? An anti-­harassment training program that said “you can only
                make off-­color jokes if others have not also made off-­color jokes” creates




                                                                  bl
                an impossible standard, one that requires workers to monitor not only

                their own speech but everyone else’s to even begin to know what is al-
                lowed or prohibited. The only reasonable approach is to ban any actions,
                words, or behaviors that might offend anyone.
                   The EEOC, largely staffed by liberal ideologues, has, as in the case of
                                                    s

                disparate impact, pushed the definition of “harassment” as far as courts
                                         lin


                have allowed them to take it. According to its website meant to provide
                guidance to employers, offensive conduct may include “offensive jokes,”
                “insults or put-­downs,” “ridicule or mockery,” or “offensive objects or
                                ol



                pictures.”39 Moreover, the harasser does not need to be the victim’s su-
                pervisor; he could even be “an agent of the employer, a co-­worker, or a
                     rC




                non-­employee.” Following the standard articulated in Rogers, a person
                can be a victim of harassment without their being the individual tar-
        pe




                geted by the offensive conduct. Jokes between two parties can result in a
                lawsuit from a third. It is little wonder that human resource profession-
                als tend to recommend a zero tolerance approach to offensive speech.

                   One can see a real-­world application of civil rights law in the case of
                James Damore, the Google engineer who was fired in 2017 for suggest-

                ing that female underrepresentation in certain technical fields might
                be due to sex differences in personality and preferences. Damore was
                part of a lawsuit against the company, filed partly on the grounds that
                he faced discrimination as a white male and for his conservative views,
                as California makes politically based discrimination illegal. Eventually,

                he settled with the company, though many legal commentators argued
                that Google needed to fire Damore to avoid creating a discriminatory
                environment for women. While the civil suit against Google was settled,
                a lawyer for National Labor Relations Board relied on EEOC guidance
                to conclude that Damore’s speech was not protected, and Google was

                not discriminating against whites and men because his memo expressed
                belief in stereotypes about women.40 It is unlikely that the management

                of Google was sympathetic to Damore’s viewpoint, but the important
                thing to realize is that even if they were, civil rights law probably made
                firing him the right business decision.

                As originally written, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, unlike Title VII,
                did not ban discrimination on account of sex. That change came with
                the Education Amendments of 1972, which included a provision in Ti-
                tle IX stating that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis

                and universities, and while one can fault other civil rights doctrines for
                being vague, under Title IX the Office for Civil Rights has promulgated
        pe




                rules and regulations in painstaking detail.
                   Under American law, Congress passes statutes, and agencies make
                “rules” interpreting them. These rules are made through a highly for-
ar




                malized process that, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),
                involves a “notice and comment” period in which the public can submit
H




                feedback regarding what a particular agency is proposing. Of course, even
                rules don’t cover every possible ambiguity in interpretation, so agencies
                sometimes also make statements that clarify rules. Importantly, this is
                not supposed to be a way to make substantive changes to underlying law.

                race and sex discrimination. Shortly after Title IX was passed, however,
                it became clear that there were important fundamental differences be-
                tween the two concepts. In 1974 and 1976, Congress added Title IX
                exemptions that allowed for different living facilities for men and
                women, and for fraternities and sororities; scholarships for beauty




                                                                                      rs
                pageants; the Boy Scouts; and father-­son and mother-­daughter events.41
                As women made rapid gains in education, Title IX began to bizarrely fo-




                                                                          he
                cus more and more on sports, an area in which men have always shown
                more interest. The law came to in effect require something approaching
                equality, or making progress toward equality, in athletic participation.




                                                                        is
                Its other major effect has been to make the federal government regulate
                the sex lives of college students.




                                                                  bl
                    The process through which we got from the text of Title IX to a fed-

                eral government obsessed with sports and sex in college is hardly be-
                lievable in a country that prides itself on the rule of law. In every society
                that has ever existed, men have shown more interest in athletic compe-
                tition than women, and the wider society has been more interested in

                seeing athletic contests between men than between women, which is
                                         lin


                unsurprising given higher levels of male athletic performance and ag-
                gression.42 Thus a natural interpretation of Title IX as applied to sports
                would simply say that colleges and universities needed to provide men
                                ol



                and women similar opportunities in ways that take into account the dif-
                ferences between them. In fact, this would have been a completely rea-
                     rC




                sonable interpretation of the 1975 rules promulgated by OCR—­then part
                of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare—­which stated
        pe




                that schools needed to “effectively accommodate the interests and abil-
                ities of both sexes.”43
                    As political scientist R. Shep Melnick writes, this was officially the
ar




                last time that the federal government made a major change to Title IX,
                as OCR has simply been issuing “clarifications” to the text of Title IX
H




                and its 1975 rules ever since.44 The most important of these came in 1979,
                when OCR issued a “three-­part test” to determine whether schools were
                discriminating against women in the field of athletics. In 1993 and 1996,
                the First Circuit issued two opinions in Cohen v. Brown University that
                strengthened that test and, in effect, required that the demographics

                whole. Other circuits followed, and in 1996 OCR issued another “clarifi-
                cation,” endorsing the Cohen standard. Melnick calls this “leapfrogging,”
                the process of “courts and agencies each taking a step beyond the other,
                expanding regulation without seeming to innovate.”45 When Quinnipiac




                                                                                    rs
                University was sued in 2010, “the district court relied heavily on OCR’s
                1996 ‘clarification’ of its 1979 ‘interpretation’ of its 1975 regulations.”




                                                                           he
                Congress has acknowledged that statutory text is often insufficient to
                provide complete guidance as to how an agency should fulfill its mis-
                sion, which is why it created the rule-­making process specified in the




                                                                         is
                APA. To ignore that process in order to create substantial changes in the
                law subverts the entire system, but OCR has gotten away with it when




                                                                  bl
                the courts have let it.                 Pu
                   Simply requiring equality in the number of varsity athletes has
                not settled the issue, however. Courts and government bureaucrats
                have found themselves in the position of ruling on the merits of vari-
                ous sports. In the Quinnipiac case, it was determined that “competitive

                cheering and tumbling” did not count for the purposes of Title IX, so the
                                         lin


                school had to reinstate the women’s volleyball team.46 When faced with
                clear evidence that women are less interested in sports than men, reg-
                ulators and judges have responded that this is due to sex stereotyping,
                                ol



                and that civil rights law requires schools and universities to make men
                and women more psychologically similar. For this reason, social engi-
                    rC




                neers have shown a distinct hostility to counting cheerleading as a sport,
                as well as refusing to countenance less competitive and all-­consuming
        pe




                models of female athletic involvement, including one that as of 1972
                was represented by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for
                Women (AIAW)—­an organization that could have been the female

                version of the NCAA had federal regulators and judges not imposed
                the model of the male organization on both sexes.47 There is nothing

                in the text of Title IX that mentions sports, and women outnumbering
                men in student government, music, and other kinds of extracurricular
                activities has never bothered OCR or the federal judiciary.48
                   Just as civil rights law in employment imposes soft quotas to get
                around the fact that some groups have more productive workers than

                others, so too colleges and universities have had to deal with the hard
                fact that men are more interested in athletics by cutting male sports
                and padding their numbers of female athletes through methods such
                as including on lists those who never attend practices or games and
                double-­or triple-­counting participants.49 One common loophole even

                a 1972 law.
                   As bizarre as the saga of Title IX in sports has been, the federal gov-
                ernment here looks prudent and restrained when we examine how the
                                                    s

                same law has come to be used to impose a radical understanding of het-

                erosexual relations on higher education. As with the field of college ath-
                letics, OCR has avoided following both the plain text of the law and the
                official rule-­making process as the avenue through which to make major
                                ol



                policy changes. In the 1990s, it started to inch toward importing harass-
                ment law as it developed under Title VII into Title IX regulations to
                     rC




                regulate social life at schools and universities.52 After the Supreme Court
                made clear that it would look skeptically on any attempts to “transfer”
        pe




                harassment law from the context of employment to education, OCR be-
                gan to ignore Title VII.
                   In the first decades of Title IX, the law did not even address peer-­to-­
ar




                peer harassment but required schools to create grievance procedures
                to determine whether institutions themselves were discriminating.53 It
H




                was only in 1997 that OCR put out guidance that created an affirma-
                tive duty to stop sexual harassment, and on the last day of the Clin-
                ton administration it issued a thirty-­seven-­page document that detailed
                how schools should handle categories of harassment. New innovations
                allowed for subjectivity in deciding which conduct was prohibited and

                order to constitute a violation of Title IX.54

                both a microcosm and an extreme example of this particular effect
                of civil rights law.55 The Obama administration ushered in grievance

                   The administration also showed how elastic the concept of “discrim-
                ination” could be. A White House task force created a model survey

                remarks about a person’s physical appearance to rape.57 This document
                helped provide the basis for assessments on campus climate carried out
                by colleges and universities across the country, and ultimately led to
                                ol



                headlines that alleged astronomically high levels of sexual violence on
                college campuses. The Obama-­era regulations also resulted in kangaroo
                    rC




                courts in which convictions of men accused of sexual assault were all
                but assured, even for alleged conduct that was by all accounts legal.

                   The Department of Education under Obama also put a large em-
                phasis on shaping the beliefs, actions, and behaviors of students and
                university employees. Melnick notes that “no word is repeated more

                ing to “prevent domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and

                “affirmative,” if not “enthusiastic,” consent for sexual behavior; define

                it did not consider applicants as individuals. However, in Grutter, the Su-
        pe




                preme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School admission
                process, which considered race but in a more “holistic” way that sought
                to achieve a “critical mass” of underrepresented minority students.

                American, Latino, and Native American students. Every year they ap-

                tioned, courts and bureaucrats treat cognitive tests with suspicion, but
                they have generally ignored college degree requirements despite their
                having, similarly, a disparate impact. As of 2019, among those twenty-­

                compared to 52 percent of Asians, 26 percent of blacks, and 19 percent
                of Hispanics. Clearly any employer that requires a BA or postgraduate
                degree could be accused of engaging in a practice that has a disparate

                   What can explain such inconsistencies? It would be naive to attribute
                them to any neutral interpretation of the law. Someone who carefully
                read reports on the current state of the law but was unfamiliar with what
                positions conservatives and liberals took on Covid-19 would not have
                guessed that civil rights law would consider bans on mask mandates, but

                not school closures, as potential violations. Meanwhile, someone who
                knew nothing of the law but was a close observer of American politics

                   Under the standards of disparate impact and anti-­harassment, the
                EEOC has gone after private businesses for using criminal background

                male and female cocktail servers.79 The most absurd prosecutions do oc-

                endeavor for what is usually an uncertain result, and most employers
                would rather fold on the issue in question or, if necessary, find a new line
                                ol



                of work. Settlements are often cheaper than fighting a charge in court;
                hence most prosecutions do not make it that far. Similarly, the OFCCP

                   If it seems that our culture has built an elaborate ranking system of

                has expanded beyond issues of race and sex. Protecting “voting rights” has

                    In 1992, about 1 percent of EEOC charges, meaning formal accusations
                brought to its attention, were for discrimination based on disability. By
                2021, that had risen to 37 percent.85 The Americans with Disabilities Act
                adds yet another cost to doing business. It increases the power of social
                engineers within the federal bureaucracy to decide questions that should,

                Justice Antonin Scalia pointed out in a biting 2001 dissent in a case in

                    Finally, there is Section 1981, which was part of the Civil Rights Act
                of 1866. It guaranteed the ability to make and enforce contracts without
                being discriminated against based on race. In 1968 the Supreme Court
                decided that this provision banned discrimination in the sale or rental

                   Although no court or bureaucrat would put it in such terms, the prac-

                allowed but required. Moreover, while free speech exists in theory under
                civil rights law, in practice it often does not, as human resources offices




                                                                  bl
                clamp down on ideas, jokes, and opinions that bureaucrats and judges

                may find offensive because no individual controls the patterns of behav-
                ior within any particular institution.
                   The distinctions between wokeness as culture and wokeness as law
                begin to break down when we think about the interaction between the
                                                    s

                two. An American employer is a private actor but also someone whose
                                         lin


                ideas about his role in society and professional obligations are shaped
                by the government regulations he lives under. A bureaucrat in the
                OFCCP is a government agent but also an active participant in shaping
                                ol



                the cultures of corporations. Drawing the line between law and culture
                becomes even more difficult when we consider the bureaucracies that
                    rC




                have grown within private institutions in response to civil rights law. A
                Title IX coordinator who believes that the United States is a white su-
        pe




                premacist patriarchy is not only a symbol of the ideological extremism
                of the American university but a product of federal regulations.
                   Two of the central tenets of wokeness identified in the first chapter—­

                trine in any legal textbook. In practice, for over half a century, employ-
                ers and educational establishments have been forced to act as if they
                are. The third pillar of wokeness, that is, the new bureaucratic class that
                has risen in order to enforce the doctrines of the faith, is the subject of
                the next chapter.

                When most people think about what types of people are affiliated with
                universities, they usually think of professors and students. That impres-
                sion is dated, as higher education has been taken over by professional
                                                    s

                managers who neither teach nor do research. Yale currently has about

                as many administrators and managers as it does students.1 Many new
                employees have job titles that did not exist only a few decades before. As
                of 2020, Ohio State University employed 132 administrators with “diver-

                sity” or “equity” in their job titles at the cost of $13.4 million.2
                   What has happened in academia has only been an extreme example
                    rC




                of a more general bureaucratization of American life. It was not always
                like this. In November 1971, Columbia University president William J.
        pe




                McGill wrote an open letter in which he lamented that, due to affirma-
                tive action regulations, “We are no longer in all respects an indepen-
                dent private university.”3 The Department of Health, Education, and
ar




                Welfare was threatening to cut off federal funding unless the university
                provided employment data based on race and sex and timetables for
H




                hiring minorities. President McGill wrote that Columbia had a decen-
                tralized form of administration, in which individual departments were
                allowed to act independently. The university simply did not have the
                administrative capabilities to comply with new mandates coming from
                Washington, which required painstaking record keeping to prove that

                the institution was not discriminating against women and minorities.
                President McGill pointed out that bureaucratic bloat “will add to our
                burdens and our costs but we have been told that if we wish to continue
                to have federal resources, that is what we must do. Accordingly, we must
                do it.”




                                                                                    rs
                    Decades later, universities were once again struggling with the fed-
                eral government, this time over its micromanaging of athletics under




                                                                      he
                Title IX. At one point the president of Brown University asked how was
                it that schools were “free to cut libraries and academic departments,
                but not athletics.”4 Eventually, after losing in a series of court cases in




                                                                    is
                the 1990s, as with affirmative action decades before, higher education
                came to identify with and support the costly regulations it once rallied




                                                             bl
                against. Though universities today represent the ideological extreme,

                they were not always this way, and one should understand their trans-
                formation over time as a product of government intervention.
                    In the case of higher education, we can most easily trace the rise of
                bureaucracy to civil rights law. Yet colleges and universities have sim-
                                                    s

                ply moved in step with trends that have also affected American busi-

                ness since the 1960s, and the underlying mechanisms at work appear to
                be the same. Civil rights law has led to an expansive human resources
                industry in the private and public sectors for three reasons. First, the
                                ol



                law is vague: while it requires soft quotas and speech restrictions to a
                certain degree, an employer can never be sure just which aspects of hir-
                    rC




                ing, promotion, and firing must take into account race, sex, and other
                protected identities, and precisely how; exactly which speech is banned;
        pe




                and what a firm’s obligations are in monitoring workers and enforcing
                speech codes.
                    None of this would matter all that much if civil rights law wasn’t also
ar




                self-­financing, the second reason for the existence of a robust human
                resources industry. Unlike in other areas of law, successful litigants can
H




                get attorney’s fees for lawsuits. The practice of awarding punitive dam-
                ages, codified in the CRA of 1991, has further contributed to an incentive
                problem in which employers face penalties for running afoul of the law
                that are disproportionate to the tangible harms caused.
                    Finally, there is the “best practices” doctrine, through which an

                institution can defend itself by showing that it is behaving in accordance
                with industry norms. Employers must pay attention not only to what
                judges and bureaucrats think but to the things that other corporations
                are doing to address discrimination. This creates an arms race, which
                helps explain why practices that once seemed absurd can become

                was nothing inevitable about a portion of this class taking on social en-
                gineering as a career. This was a unique result of the characteristics of
                the American civil rights regime. Has this improved business efficiency
                and ameliorated problems inherent in having different kinds of people
                work together? Many in the human resources sector would certainly say

                so, but if they are correct, it raises the question of why the civil rights
                regime has been needed in the first place.

                to your sister.” The son may well ask, “What does it mean to be mean to
                                                         Pu
                her?” At this point, the father can take one of two paths. He can give a
                list of dos and don’ts—­don’t yell at her, share a toy if she asks for it, and
                include her in any games you play with your friends. The other path he
                can take is to replace one vague standard with another. In response to the
                                                    s

                question of what it means to be mean, the father might say, “Do not take

                any action that will make your sister feel uncomfortable or create a bur-
                den substantial enough to interfere with her full enjoyment of playtime.”
                    Three effects here are worthy of note. First, the son still faces un-
                                ol



                certainty in how to behave. Arguably, the definition of “being mean”
                is more confusing than the original phrase itself, not least because the
                     rC




                father is using words that the son might not understand. If the father
                simply said “don’t be mean,” he and the son would quibble over the

                to be “mean,” one now can quibble over several phrases, like “substan-
                tial” and “full enjoyment of playtime.” The father has pretended to pro-

                sister uncomfortable today might do so as she grows a bit older. Finally,
                the father has sent a signal that he has a broad interpretation of what
                it means to be mean. The son does not have exact guidance on how to
                behave, but he now at least knows that anything he does is potentially

                ply not going out of his way to make her feel bad is off the table. If he’s
                going to listen to his father, he needs to incorporate her interests and
                feelings into most of what he does.

                could have had a standard that said “don’t do anything racist or sexist.”
                That would be an arbitrary standard, but adding more words has the ef-
                fect of only making the rule look more exact and precise, while in effect

                   Civil rights law “clarifies” what statutes mean with words that are at
                least as vague as the original definition, with the added problem that they

                without specialized training. But what such standards do make clear is
                that there are few limits on what practices, speech, or actions a court
                or bureaucrat might find objectionable. In the end, the father giving his

                interest in and ideological commitment to applying the broadest possible

                   The “pervasiveness” requirement naturally leads to the adoption of
                zero tolerance policies in corporate America. The law is clear that “iso-
                lated” statements or actions cannot give rise to a cause of action, but
ar




                there is no way for an employer to adopt a rule that says dirty jokes
                are only allowed if the total number of dirty jokes stays below some

                undefined threshold. The EEOC therefore naturally tells businesses
                to “avoid race-­based or culturally offensive humor or pranks. When in
                doubt, leave it outside the workplace.”7
                   Is vagueness an inevitable feature of modern law? Perhaps to a certain
                extent, as no legislation can give exact guidance for every possible situ-

                the American system is unique in the vagueness of its legislative guid-
                ance. The idea that the powers of the federal government are limited is
                a fundamental principle of American law, but applying that principle can

                lead to some counterintuitive results. In their 1998 paper “The Strength of

                show how across various areas of law, the American government regu-
                lates in an indirect way, which paradoxically leads to more bureaucracy.8

                as an example of a strong state, one that has been able to create a quota
                for hiring handicapped employees and has laws regarding employment
                that are stable and enforced exclusively through the Ministry of Labor.

                   In contrast, the American state is “weak.” It does not mandate quo-

                tas; in fact, it explicitly bans them. Instead, government contractors
                have “goals” and “timetables” they set themselves, and all large em-
                ployers must be on the lookout for “disparate impact” in a world where

                everything has a disparate impact. Enforcement is also highly decentral-
                ized. In the private sector, an employer may face negative consequences

                voke private lawsuits that will help enforce federal regulatory policy,
                a series of laws and court decisions have stacked the deck in favor of
                plaintiffs in this particular area.9
                    Under the “American Rule” that is the default in civil cases, each side
                in a lawsuit pays for its own legal representation regardless of who wins.

                The Civil Rights Act of 1964, however, in Section 706(k), says that in a
                Title VII suit, “the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party,




                                                                        he
                other than the [EEOC] or the United States, a reasonable attorney’s
                fee.”10 Congress later passed the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Award Act
                of 1976, which applied the same rule to practically all other kinds of civil




                                                                      is
                rights cases, including Title VI and Title IX.11
                    The deal struck in 1964 as written could have had the effect of both

                Garment Co. v. EEOC (1978), interpreted Section 706(k) to mean that
                the default rule under Title VII was that successful plaintiffs should
                get attorney’s fees and successful defendants could not, unless there
                                                    s

                were unusual circumstances. As with Griggs and other cases, a carefully

                constructed legislative bargain designed to balance a trade-­off between
                combating anti-­discrimination and other concerns was thrown out in
                favor of more aggressive enforcement.

                    Some countries have a “loser pays” system as the default, and the
                Civil Rights Act appeared to follow their lead in this area of the law. Due

                to Christiansburg, however, we now have an asymmetry in which plain-
                tiffs have a right to recover attorney’s fees if they win, but defendants
        pe




                must swallow the costs of defending themselves even when courts have
                determined they have done nothing wrong. The important Ninth Circuit
                has gone even further than that. In Skaff v. Meridien North Am. Beverly

                Hills, LLC (2007), a disabled man sued a hotel for lack of accessibil-
                ity. Even though the two sides reached a settlement, the appellate court
H




                ruled that the plaintiff could still pursue legal fees under the Americans
                with Disabilities Act and California law. In the end, the plaintiff, who
                had before filed twenty-­one similar cases in California, was awarded
                $15,000 in the settlement, but his lawyer sought $118,000 from the hotel
                for working on the case.

                    The CRA of 1991 explicitly allows for punitive damages under both
                Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is, like the al-
                lowance of attorney’s fees, extremely rare for any area of law.12 That is,
                plaintiffs are allowed to receive money beyond what is necessary to rea-
                sonably compensate them for any harm they have suffered. In addition

                to certainty, a key part of a well-­functioning legal system is proportional-

                do not award punitive damages at all. They are usually found in com-
                mon law countries, however, such as the UK and Australia. In the United
                States, punitive damages in most areas of law are usually determined on

                a state-­by-­state basis, while under civil rights law a right to receive such
                damages exists under a federal statute.




                                                                  bl
                    This has led to outrageous results, with lawyers and plaintiffs re-

                ceiving windfalls for conduct that is radically disproportionate to any
                harm suffered. While the Civil Rights Act of 1991 caps punitive and non­
                pecuniary damages at $300,000 per individual for major companies, the
                judiciary’s acceptance of class action lawsuits in civil rights cases—­once

                an individual right not to be discriminated against into a group right.
                This created massive potential liability.13
                    Title VII cases are often tried in the media, where the slightest hint

                The deeper the pockets of an institution, the more likely it is to be tar-
                geted. A January 2019 report revealed that 99 percent of Fortune 500
        pe




                companies had made payments to at least one plaintiff in a harassment
                or discrimination lawsuit since 2000.14 As of 2019, the companies that
                have paid the most in disclosed settlements are Bank of America ($210
ar




                million), Coca-­Cola ($200 million), Novartis ($183 million), Morgan
                Stanley ($150 million), and Abercrombie & Fitch ($90 million). The fact
H




                that nearly every Fortune 500 company has been targeted indicates that
                this is not a matter of a few bad actors. Rather, courts will inevitably
                find instances of discrimination no matter what is happening, given the
                nature of harassment law and the disparate impact doctrine.

                crushing penalties for a corporation. In 2015 and 2016, a black father
                and son named Owen Diaz and Demetric Di-­az [sic] worked at a Tesla
                plant. They sued the company for racial discrimination, with the fa-

                but the aggregate effect of civil rights law is to fund a certain kind of
                legal and political activism that depends on the belief that racism and
        pe




                sexism are pervasive factors in American life. While Bank of America,
                for example, has paid hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two
                decades in settling civil rights cases, such costs are easily absorbable
ar




                by a corporation that makes billions in net income each quarter. The
                problem, again, is that the machine is self-­financing, and it has become

                on new responsibilities and funnel money to civil rights lawyers and
                activists.
                   In July 2020 the Department of Justice reached a settlement with
                Bank of America over its old policy of refusing loans to adults under

                in total to victims, but the settlement also “requires the Bank to main-
                tain the new, non-­discriminatory loan underwriting policies,” “train
                its employees on the new policies,” and “monitor its loan processing

                   A study of all class action settlements in the federal courts between

                49 percent and 75 percent.18 In other words, compared to other types of

                likely to be required to take on indirect burdens. An analysis from 1980
                found that OFCCP regulations had increased the labor and capital costs
                of federal contractors by 6.5 percent, which according to a 1993 estimate
                                                    s

                   Moreover, the money that is paid in lawsuits and settlements, while
                being small in terms of how much profit large corporations make, can

                be enough to keep the civil rights industry going. When Coca-­Cola

                inating against black employees, $20 million of that went to legal fees.20
                The company was also required to appoint a seven-­member task force
        pe




                to supervise its human resource and hiring practices for four years. Un-

                of lawyers, activists, and human resources professionals.

                crimination” is more profitable than seeking to correct other supposed
                injustices. President Calvin Coolidge famously said that “the chief busi-
                ness of the American people is business.” Today, one might say that the
                main business of the federal courts is social engineering. If an individual

                In 2020, there were about 1.5 million businesses in the US with at least
                fifteen or more employees, the threshold to be covered under Title VII
                of the Civil Rights Act and the ADA. With sixty-­seven thousand charges

                is important to note that one individual can file more than one charge
                against the same firm, and, because civil rights law is a business, the
                risks to large employers are surely higher than for small ones. Nonethe-

                bar that profits from imposing costs on alleged violators, in addition to
                liberal organizations more generally.

                   The fact that around 10–20 percent of all civil cases filed in federal

                in fighting this particular harm. Of all the issues our legal system could
                be addressing, it is interesting that so much effort and attention is now
                     rC




                directed at a kind of private cause of action that was not even recog-
                nized as part of the legal system until recent decades. Not that long ago,
        pe




                a fundamental principle of Anglo-­American legal thought was that the
                remedy to discrimination practiced by a private party was to take one’s
                business or labor elsewhere. That is still the default when an individual
ar




                is wronged in a noncriminal manner on any basis other than some “pro-
                tected” status. While centuries of mistreatment of black Americans have
H




                been used to justify a more activist government that now has powers
                that go beyond historical limits, the anti-­discrimination principle has
                expanded to create two kinds of private ill-­treatment based on a myriad
                of different kinds of identity, without anyone giving much thought as to
                why this should have been done.

                                        The “Best Practices” Doctrine

                Game theorists have shown how rational actors can make decisions
                that, while sensible for individuals, make everyone worse off. For exam-
                ple, if nations have no way to verify how much other states are investing




                                                                                   rs
                in their military, one can easily end up with an arms race that no one
                wants. No matter what the other side is doing, each country can have




                                                                      he
                an incentive to spend more to keep up with potential adversaries, even
                if everyone would be better off if they all disarmed instead. Civil rights
                law, through its vagueness, works in a similar way. Each corporation has




                                                                    is
                an incentive to seem “less discriminatory” than others, which in effect
                means adopting fads out of academia or the HR industry and having to

                engage in ever more blatant forms of reverse discrimination.

                    The “best practices” approach has been indirectly endorsed by the
                judiciary. In two cases decided in 1998, the Supreme Court created an
                affirmative defense for sexual harassment claims, based on an employer
                exercising “reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly” any of-
                                                    s

                fending conduct and an employee unreasonably failing to use available
                                         lin


                opportunities to address the problem. As a result, lawyers and HR pro-
                fessionals explicitly tell businesses that having a bureaucratized com-
                plaint process can protect them from lawsuits. While the Supreme
                                ol



                Court has said that an anti-­harassment policy is not needed in every
                case, courts are virtually unanimous in finding that not having one pre-
                    rC




                cludes an affirmative defense to harassment.28 That is not to say that an
                anti-­harassment policy is sufficient to beat back a discrimination claim.
        pe




                Courts have looked favorably on additional steps that can be taken, in-
                cluding anti-­harassment training and reprimanding supposed harassers
                and separating them from their alleged victims.29 Under such circum-
ar




                stances, HR and DEI professionals have been able to sell their services
                as a good business investment, and can reasonably tell firms that they
H




                might be in trouble if they don’t do at least as much as other employers
                to prevent harassment.
                    This natural tendency of civil rights law to devolve into a “woke arms
                race” has been given official sanction by the OFCCP and the EEOC,
                which are often ready to go as far as the judiciary will allow them to.

                The OFCCP explicitly issues regulations based on the “best practices”
                of leading firms.30 As of late 2021, it advises government contractors to
                set up outreach programs with Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
                sities, have a social media presence, develop relationships with race-­
                conscious organizations, and “encourage the creation of forum groups,

                and development programs.”31
                    While these are not official mandates, the government has made clear
                that adopting the conservative belief in race-­blindness makes an insti-




                                                                        is
                tution legally suspect. The EEOC similarly calls for “regular, interactive
                training tailored to the audience and the organization.”32 Nonetheless,




                                                                  bl
                it says that no body of regulation can cover every conceivable circum-

                stance. This means that “at best, ‘best practices’ are best guesses.”33 In
                order to guide them, employers have come to rely on the HR profes-
                sion due to its supposed expertise in such matters, or at least its abil-
                ity to make courts and regulators think that a firm takes discrimination

                    A clear example of a principle that sounds good to outsiders but cre-
                ates difficulties in practice is that of non-­retaliation.34 Under Title VII,
                an employer cannot punish a worker for filing a discrimination com-
                                ol



                plaint. As of 2019, the majority of charges filed with the EEOC had a
                retaliation component.35 An easy and natural way to deal with a difficult
                     rC




                personnel situation is to separate the parties who are having a dispute.
                Yet if that is perceived as “retaliation” in any way—­even if the original
        pe




                accusation itself lacks merit—­the employer may be guilty of commit-
                ting a Title VII violation. Thus employers must take all accusations of
                discrimination seriously, no matter how frivolous. If the firm decides to
ar




                separate the two individuals having a dispute by, for example, moving
                one of them to a different department, or even firing one of the parties,
H




                it better be the alleged perpetrator.
                    Civil rights law creates protection for an employee against suffering
                retaliation for making an accusation of discrimination, but no protec-
                tion for those falsely accused. This provides yet another example of
                how granting rights to a “protected” individual often involves violat-

                ally more concerned with making money and preventing lawsuits than
                acting in accordance with idealized standards of justice, so they comply
                with what are unofficial mandates given the current state of the law.

                the affirmative action industry, originally created to ensure compliance
                with federal mandates.36 Courts and federal bureaucrats are rarely good
                social scientists, so practices become common without any evidence

                   As the sociologist Musa al-­Gharbi has shown, corporations have
                adopted programs without any reason to think that they might improve
                their stated goals of achieving diversity and inclusion, and sometimes
                                ol



                even in spite of evidence that they may backfire.37 For example, the Im-

                its validity, while diversity training can demoralize members of a mi-
                nority group and increase biased behavior.38 Given the haphazard ways

                in which civil rights law relies on vague standards and decisions made
                by government agents without a direct stake in the real world results of
                any intervention, it is easy to see why there is often an uncertain, weak,

                or even negative relationship between efforts made and the results that
                actors in the system purport to care about.

                   Even in the absence of government mandates, employers have a nat-
                ural incentive to provide an environment in which workers achieve
                maximum productivity. This involves managing different personalities,
                and conflicts that may arise due to discriminatory treatment or un-

                necessary for improving efficiency. If they are right, there is no reason
                for the law to take an interest in personnel matters; the government
                usually doesn’t have to force businesses to do things that are in their
                own financial interest. Civil rights law, however, has not caused employ-
                ers to be more inclined to successfully manage interpersonal relations




                                                                                      rs

                Those are not the same thing. “Woke capital,” which often refers to cor-

                   Before the 1960s, markets were the system through which American

                programs, a number that increased to 530 by 1970.
                   Even as of 1969, there were few strings attached to this kind of fund-

                   Relying on taxpayers for funding, instead of market forces, govern-

                and jobs that do not lead to productivity gains. This is especially appar-

                the number of K–12 teachers in the US increased by 8 percent from 2000
                to 2017, the number of administrators increased by 75 percent.50 At the
                level of higher education, there has been a steady increase in admin-
                                ol



                istrative costs since the beginning of the civil rights era, a trend that
                has accelerated in recent decades. In the 1980s, administrative costs per
                     rC




                student increased by 46 percent.51 Even by the early 1990s, leading uni-
                versities had slightly more administrators than teachers or researchers,
        pe




                and the gap has widened since.52 Looking at just full-­time staff, between
                1993 and 2007 the rate of new jobs for administrators grew at about four
                times the rate as for those working on research, teaching, or providing
ar




                student services.
                   While this cannot all be attributed to civil rights law, the historical
H




                record is clear that administrative bloat results from federal money that
                comes with strings attached. The federal relations director of the Asso-
                ciation of American Universities once put forward what he called “ad-
                ministrative clone theory,” in which every new form of federal spending
                comes with a new federal office to administer the money, and then

                “clones” of the department are created at each university.53 The reason
                administrators keep deciding to spend more money on administration
                is because they can; given that administrators rather than faculty exer-
                cise ultimate control over budgets, it is spending on their own jobs and
                privileges that we should expect to increase.

                   The growth of the Title IX bureaucracy during the Obama adminis-

                the effects of more micro-­level regulations. As of 2016, more than two
                hundred colleges and universities faced a Title IX investigation by the
                federal government over the handling of sexual assault allegations, an

                made sexual assault the responsibility of university administrators;

                newfound responsibilities placed on them four decades after the origi-
                nal passing of Title IX, universities started scrambling to hire “lawyers,

                by about $2 million between 2013 and 2016 alone. Around this time, Yale
                had thirty faculty and staff members working on Title IX efforts and
                                ol



                Harvard had fifty Title IX coordinators. In September 2017, the Trump

                however, business leaders have their hands full simply doing their own
                jobs. The division of labor is a key feature of modern economies. As
                society becomes more complex, the more specialized the workforce

                the next decades, it would grow into a massive community, today com-
                prising around 1 percent of the workforce. While many professions do
                their work out in the open, HR, and more recently the DEI complex, are
                working mostly behind the scenes to shape the rules and regulations

                terpersonal relations are governed in modern society, blame must first
                and foremost be attributed to government agencies that regulate them,

                nature, history, culture, and the aggregate preferences and decisions

                who is given the task of defending everything, a movement faced with an

                so thin that they are overwhelmed or decide that it is trying to do the

                With that framework in mind, the natural point of attack is civil rights
                law. In the US, the government does not have the power to dismantle
                the human resources and DEI professions through brute force. What

                To act otherwise is to get upset at the state of modern architecture and
                ignore architects to focus on the critics who praise their work or the

                system they are a part of.
                   While it may be theoretically interesting to take a broader view of the

                context in which the architects of wokeness perform their work, in the
                end a successful movement puts most of its energy toward fighting
                the group directly responsible for the problem it seeks to solve. Seeing
ar




                woke­ness as a kind of “class warfare” is generally correct, but the class in

                generally but the managers of human relations. That implies, first and
                foremost, going after rules that make civil rights litigation lucrative to
                plaintiffs and threatening to firms, in addition to checking the power
                of OCR, OFCCP, EEOC, and, when possible, the HR and DEI industries.

                In the early to mid-1950s, I Love Lucy was the highest-­rated TV show
                in the United States. It centered around the life of Ricky Ricardo (Desi
                Arnaz) and his wife, Lucy (Lucille Ball). Ricky ran a nightclub, and his

                executives’ fears, Americans did not think it objectionable that the most
                popular show in the country featured what some might have considered
                                ol



                an “interracial marriage.” It was only in Loving v. Virginia, decided in
                1967, that the Supreme Court would invalidate anti-­miscegenation laws

                of the white race regularly welcomed Lucy and Ricky into their homes
                without giving the issue of race much thought.
                   In this, they were taking the lead of their government. On the 1950
ar




                Census, the racial options were “White,” “Negro,” “American Indian,”
                “Japanese,” “Chinese,” “Filipino,” and “Other.” As late as the 1960s,

                Mexican American activists rejected the idea that they should be labeled
                non-­white.1 By the 1970s, however, when the federal government was
                classifying citizens and then distributing benefits and imposing costs
                based on those classifications, they were taking a different position.

                that had a substantial minority of fellow Arab students. Every so often,

                usually when taking a standardized test, we were asked to identify our
                race. I remember there once being confusion in junior high over which
                box Arabs should check. The teacher looked down at a sheet of paper

                In high school, I was once in a computer lab in which a fellow student
                came across a demographic survey on a website that asked the respon-
                dent for his racial identification. When someone asked where Arabs
                were among the options, the teacher replied that it would be more ac-

                   After 9/11, it became clearer than ever that Arabs and Muslims were

                an “other” in American culture. The Council on American-­Islamic Re-
                lations (CAIR), formed in 1994 on the model of other civil rights orga-
                    rC




                nizations, came to play a more prominent role in American politics. Yet
                discrimination against Arabs and Muslims has been treated as a relatively
        pe




                minor political issue. One rarely hears about the “underrepresentation”
                of either group in any particular field, nor does anyone ever discuss their
                crime rates or standardized test scores. We do not even know for cer-
ar




                tain whether Muslims, or Arabs for that matter, are underrepresented
                or overrepresented among prisoners or those of higher or lower socio-
H




                economic status. While some studies on the topic have been done, the
                Census does not ask about these categories, and neither do those who
                collect arrest data or administer standardized tests. The data we have is
                therefore less copious and of lower quality than numbers pertaining to
                officially designated “races,” and as a result, much less relied upon.

                    In 2020, the “Asian American Pacific Islander” community was said

                #StopAAPIHate became a rallying cry for journalists, activists, and aca-
                demics. This community was supposedly being represented by an orga-

                have no background in common except for the fact that they are neither
                black nor white. The media in recent years has run countless stories
                about increasing hate crimes against “AAPIs,” along with numbers

                newspapers like the New York Times to build a larger narrative.2

                    A moment’s thought reveals how strange this narrative is. The coro-
                navirus, as far as we know, began in China, and it is plausible that Amer-
                icans of Korean, Japanese, or Vietnamese descent might in the last few
                years have suffered discrimination at the hands of bigots too ignorant

                to differentiate between these groups. Yet there is no reason to believe

                that Americans of Samoan or Indian descent should have seen an uptick

                    Although not to the same extent, the government has also helped
                usher in the idea of gender and sexual orientation as relevant politi-
                cal categories that institutions must take account of. At the time of the
                                ol



                Civil Rights Act, there was a consensus in the United States that men
                and women had different roles to play in society, and the Diagnostic and
                    rC




                Statistical Manual-­II released four years later classified homosexuality
                as a mental disorder. Relatively few had heard of the concept of “gender
        pe




                identity.” Yet over the next few decades, government, mostly through
                the courts and the federal bureaucracy, would set out to do away with
                stereotypes in the workplace, micromanage norms regarding dating,

                    We see a common pattern in how the government has socially con-
                structed race and how it has helped legitimize a certain conception of
                womanhood as the kind that deserves to be favored and cultivated by
                the state. The government decides which categories are relevant to pub-
                lic life, and which are not. It then goes about encouraging a system of

                of course were always seen as a distinct category, but government in
                the late 1960s began to come down in favor of an extremely specific
                vision of womanhood, one that prioritized the feelings and ambitions of

                the importance of children and family. While civil rights law promises

                In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) revised Directive
ar




                No. 15, which required a minimum of five categories for the purposes of

                Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,
                and White.”5 There also continued to be two categories for “ethnicity”:
                “Hispanic or Latino” and “Not Hispanic or Latino.” This was in contrast
                to the original 1977 directive, which allowed the Asian American and
                Pacific Islander categories to be counted together.6 The federal govern-

                reporting crime statistics by race or the Office of the Director of Na-

                is the fact that practically every major private institution in the United

                classifies people according to race. First of all, the racial classifications—­
                the macro-­   categories and the lines between them—­          look arbitrary.
                Groups such as Arabs, Jews, North Africans, and those from the Cau-
                casus are rarely counted either within or outside government. Like the
                                                    s

                Italians and Irish, they are considered part of the homogeneous white

                standard against which diversity accomplishments are to be judged.
                The government cares about your ratio of whites to non-­whites; it
                does not care whether your whites are Jews, Arabs, or Anglo-­Saxons.
                                ol



                At the same time, those who are non-­white need to be aggregated into
                large enough groups for the purposes of record keeping and reporting;
                    rC




                hence the categories “Hispanic” and “Asian.” Second, institutions prac-
                tically never provide religious breakdowns. There is no particular reason
        pe




                to believe that discrimination based on religious status is unworthy of
                consideration by a society that keeps such detailed records on ethnic-
                ity. If the federal government and major corporations were as obsessed

                between Southern Baptists and Episcopalians as they are with dispari-

                    This is fundamentally strange, because nearly all the arguments
                made for government race-­consciousness apply to religion. One might
                say that blacks and Native Americans have historically faced unique
                circumstances in this country. But society shows a deep interest in the

                Dwight Eisenhower followed Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman in
                signing an executive order outlawing discrimination based on race or
                national origin in government contracting. In 1956, the executive branch
                required contractors to count only “Negros” and “other minorities,”
                                                    s

                with the option to engage in more fine-­grained analysis. Under pressure

                from activists and members of Congress, “Spanish Americans” would
                soon be added. Not until the Kennedy administration did the govern-
                ment start to count Native Americans and “Orientals.” Nonetheless, al-

                ready in 1966 the EEOC required sixty thousand employers, those with
                one hundred employees or more, to list the gender and racial makeup of
                     rC




                their workforce, with the latter based on categories we would recognize
                today.13 John Skrentny sees the sending out of form EEO-1 as a water-

                shed that marks the transition from the era of official color-­blindness
                to modern race-­conscious governance. He writes that rather than “pro-
                tecting abstract Americans from the harm of discrimination, the form

                explicitly created whites and blacks, who were hired in each firm in vary-

                   Over the next decades, government would get into the race-­counting
                business in the areas of contracting, education, voting, and employ-
                ment. Not long after the Civil Rights Act was passed, the state had
                moved away from focusing on explicit discrimination in favor of look-
                ing for disparities between groups, rooting out “stereotypes,” and other

                    It is important to note that in the mid-1960s, Americans thought
                about race as a political issue in terms of the status of African Americans
                living in the South, one that was being solved through the Civil Rights

                    Despite what EEOC forms said, the 1970 Census had no category that

                The term “Spanish-­speaking” was a compromise, as “Hispanic” was ob-
                jected to by the head of the IMAA, and Puerto Rican activists sought a
                term that would include themselves.20
                   The focus on linguistic commonality provides insight into the inten-

                was “Spanish-­speaking,” Congressman Edward Roybal (D-­CA) replied
                that the new legislation would not apply to those who had assimilated
                into the American mainstream.21 In effect, he was arguing that one day,

                as soon as barriers to success had been removed, the CCOSSP could be
                disbanded. Martin Castillo, who had been appointed by Nixon to head
                     rC




                the IMAA, agreed that lack of assimilation was the main criterion by

                Puerto Ricans and Mexicans on the grounds that they were doing well
                in the United States.22 Descent from a Spanish-­speaking country or ter-

                The focus was on linguistic differences that created difficulties for full

                   Congress failed to extend the CCOSSP in 1974 after it was accused of
                having become a partisan tool of the Nixon reelection campaign.23 In

                and whether government recognition of “Hispanics” as an official mi-
                nority made sense faded away, given the realities of electoral politics
                and lobbying from within and outside the government. As it turned out,




                                                                                    rs
                it was easier to create a race than it was to disestablish one. In 1977, the

                required all federal data collection to include the Hispanic category.24
                The National Council of La Raza, originally a Chicano organization—­
                that is, focused on Mexican Americans—­became a “Hispanic” advocacy




                                                                     is
                group as it found it beneficial to conform to government classifications
                and inflate the number of those it claimed to represent.25 By 1982, it was

                relying on federal grants for 96 percent of its money. The Reagan ad-

                ministration then cut off funding, at which point it began to rely more
                heavily on private foundations and corporate donors.26
                   While the 1970s saw the solidification of Hispanics as a unified cate-
                gory for purposes of government record keeping, activists still had a lot
                                                    s

                of work to do in the cultural realm. Lobbying ensured that there would
                                         lin


                be a question about Spanish speakers on all census forms in 1980.27
                Showing how controversial this was even a few years before that change,
                the New York Times in May 1978 ran a front-­page story critical of the new
                                ol



                Hispanic category, sympathetically quoting demographers who saw its
                creation as a response to political pressure rather than as a classification
                    rC




                that captured anything worth measuring.28
                   In the end, the Census Bureau went with a Hispanic “ethnicity” ques-
        pe




                tion instead of a race question, chiefly because of worries that if it al-
                lowed respondents to say that they were part of a Hispanic “race,” it
                could reduce the number of Americans identifying as black or African
ar




                American.29 Census officials even met with black organizations to reas-
                sure them that the new Hispanic question would not dilute the numbers
H




                of their own group. Thus the arrival of an Afro-­Cuban would increase
                both the number of “blacks” and “Hispanics” in the United States. This
                is why today, when they fill out forms, Americans are usually asked to
                choose a “race” and an “ethnicity,” with Hispanic or Latino being the
                only kind of “ethnicity” officially recognized.

                   Even as of 2012, 51 percent of people of “Hispanic” descent preferred
                to refer to their country of origin to describe their identity.30 Just under
                one-­quarter (24 percent) chose “Hispanic” or “Latino,” and “American”
                (21 percent) was just behind that. In other words, close to three-­quarters
                of the “Hispanic” category either preferred an assimilationist label that

                for reasons having to do with political activism and bureaucratic con-
                venience. In the same poll, seven in ten said that American Hispanics
                did not share a culture. Yet in elite political discourse and institutions,

                alternative conceptions of identity are all but ruled out. For ethnic ac-

                   To most people of Latin American descent, ethnic politics is an ab-
                stract issue with little relevance to their social, economic, or political
                lives. When prompted to name the most important leader of their com-

                The disconnect between elites and the masses was demonstrated in the
                debate over the term “Latinx” that emerged after the 2020 election, in
                which an unexpectedly high number of Hispanics voted Republican.

                Polls showed that few Hispanics had even heard of the word, and an
                even tinier minority used it, with that minority being vastly outnum-

                bered by those who found it offensive.32 Nonetheless, the androgynous

        pe




                ment, and ethnic activism. The irony of this debate is that even the non-­

                tus markers are awarded based on the assumption that the category is
                real. The fact that even a quarter of people of Latin American descent
                call themselves “Hispanic” is a testament to the power of government
                classification, given how completely fabricated the label is. It would be

                group as an official minority early in the civil rights era was complicated
                by the fact that its members were doing quite well. Already in the 1960s,
                Chinese and Japanese Americans had incomes well above the national

                average.33 An “Oriental” category was added to government forms by the

                Kennedy administration as a result of lobbying from the congressional
                delegation of Hawaii, just a few years after the state was admitted to
                the union in 1959.34 The term was soon changed to “Asian or Pacific Is-

                Small Business Act, which provided set-­asides based on “social and eco-

                   When Directive No. 15 was revised in 1997, the resulting document

                can category, a proposal that ended up getting support from the rest of
                the Hawaiian congressional delegation. OMB was afraid that this would
                open up the issue of giving sovereignty to Native Hawaiians, a right that

                which it ended up doing in the revision to Directive No. 15 in 1997. Hence

                the American population, became one of the five major “races” in the

                of issues related to ethnic Americans, and books written on the obsta-
                cles faced by Catholics, Italians, and the Irish. In 1971, the Ford Founda-
                tion gave nearly $1 million in a series of grants to address the concerns
                of the white working class. A 1970 rally in New York City on behalf of

                certain categories of white Americans in various kinds of employment
                and other barriers they faced, much of it summarized in a 1979 report by

                    Moreover, there was direct lobbying to the federal government on
                behalf of white ethnics for inclusion. The EEOC originally denied Poles
        pe




                official minority designation on the grounds that there was no room left
                on their form, and including them might lead to demands for similar
                treatment of “Italians, Yugoslavs, Greeks, etc.”42 More extensive efforts
ar




                were made on behalf of American Jews. Reports from the Truman ad-
                ministration on civil rights gave them substantially more attention than
H




                European ethnics, and the Eisenhower administration listed Jews as one
                group that could be voluntarily reported on by employers in the “other
                minorities” category. But official efforts to use civil rights law to fight
                anti-­Semitism were eventually dropped; the justifications included
                high Jewish socioeconomic status and opposition from black activists.

                looking for practical standards and working off of little to no data.44

                themselves, and it takes only a moment of googling to find countless ex-
                amples of those on the left celebrating immigration for that very reason.
                One of my own survey experiments has shown that both conservatives

                Before the mid-1970s, the word “Hispanic” appeared in fewer than one

                in every five hundred thousand words in English-­language books. By its
                peak in the early 1990s, the frequency of the word had increased by two
                orders of magnitude. “Latino” saw a smaller and more delayed rise from

                a lower base. At the same time, “Mexican American” and “Puerto Rican”
                reached their peaks in the early 1970s and have appeared at lower rates

                since. Before this point, Americans were more likely to discuss individ-
                uals belonging to either of these groups as notable for their country or
                territory of origin rather than any wider “ethnicity.” Notably, “Hispanic”
                and “Latino” came to eclipse “Puerto Rican” and “Mexican American”

                the bill. The proposed amendment to Title VII nonetheless passed, with
                many voting for it in good faith, although the entire process initially led
                to confusion among government officials responsible for enforcement.

                on sex discrimination would lead to the government declaring war on

                gender stereotypes, micromanaging sexual relations, and even inserting

                the paradigm for fighting discrimination against blacks to women’s is-
                sues. One staff attorney would recall that because “sex discrimination
                came in as essentially a ploy by the opponents to try to derail the legis-
                lation, it is quite understandable that it was not . . . even on the radar.”49

                gender-­segregated advertising for jobs and oppose protective legislation
                at the state level that relied on assumed sex differences to regulate the

                held that not only must schools have rough proportionality between
                males and females in athletic participation, but that female sports must

                be competitive enough to be included in calculations. Thus, at least in
                the Second Circuit, a school cannot balance out a male football player
                with a female cheerleader; maybe the girl doesn’t have to play football

                   Moreover, simply offering the right number and mix of female sports
                is not enough. In 2012, the Seventh Circuit ruled that an Indiana high
                school could be sued under Title IX for scheduling boys’ basketball
                on Fridays and Saturdays and relegating girls’ games to other nights,

                “stereotypes” could not be the basis of government decision-­making,
                and sports scheduling decisions therefore had to be taken out of the

                explicit court asserted “that women’s attitudes toward sports are so-

                cially constructed and have been limited by discrimination and gender
                stereotypes,” and that the purpose of Title IX was to change that state

                of affairs.56 Title IX is the only reason such insane beliefs can become
                mandatory throughout the education system, while anyone who sought
                gender parity in, say, fantasy football interest would be a laughingstock.

                Rights Act. In its defense, the airline acknowledged that it discriminated

                against men, but argued that it was legally allowed to do so due to the
                exception in Title VII that allows for sex discrimination in the case of a
                “bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the nor-
                mal operation of that particular business or enterprise.”
                   In 1981, the Northern District of Texas rejected that argument on the




                                                                                    rs

                sary tasks of being a flight attendant or ticket agent, such discrimination
                was illegal in this case. Although Southwest Airlines argued that restrict-
                ing these positions to females was necessary for its business success, the




                                                                        is

                marker of a free society, however, is the ability of individuals and insti-
                tutions to arrange their own affairs as they see fit.
                   To take another illustrative case, in 2019 five female journalists be-
                tween the ages of forty and sixty-­one sued the TV station they worked
                                                    s

                for on the grounds of age and sex discrimination, saying that they had
                                         lin


                been pushed aside for younger women and men.58 The premise of the
                lawsuit, as in the case of the Southwest flight attendants, was that it is
                government, not employers and consumers, that decides the nature or
                                ol



                “true essence” of a job. Civil rights law gives artistic freedom to those
                who cast TV shows and movies, yet it is considered legally question-
                      rC




                able whether sex appeal can be used to sell news. One of the allegations
                of the female journalists was that management was grooming young
        pe




                women to take their jobs.
                   While this is clearly “age discrimination”—­       another monstrosity
                created by civil rights law—­the argument raises the question of how a
ar




                practice that prefers certain women over others can be a form of sex dis-
                crimination. A norm that one cannot prefer certain women for jobs be-
H




                cause of their youth or beauty does nothing to create equality between
                the sexes but is consistent with an understanding of civil rights law as
                a way for academic theories seeking social transformation to be forced
                onto private institutions.

                never realized. Strip club owners, pornographers, and movie produc-
                ers can still discriminate based on sex. Everything else, however, had
                to change, even though the notion of the government deciding whether
                the news must be read by a young, attractive woman or an older and
                unattractive one reflects a fundamental break with pre–­civil rights con-

                “sanitized” of all sexual content in the name of fighting discrimination,

                                                                     is

                single, housewives or career-­focused. When policy is made by activists
                and bureaucrats, however, it naturally becomes tilted toward the inter-
                ests and aesthetic preferences of a small minority. This is true with re-

                are less likely to seek full-­time employment. Current civil rights law
                discounts the views of women with a less hostile attitude toward tradi-
                tional heterosexual relations, whether they subscribe to a conservative

                sexual morality or not.
                   As with much in civil rights law, universities are on the cutting edge

                of the zeal for social engineering. Their ideological leanings and finan-
                cial reliance on the taxpayer mean that they are usually the institutions

                most welcoming to federal regulation in this area. The Dear Colleague

                are inherently suspicious, particularly when there is a power differential
                between a man and a woman. The ideal of womanhood under civil rights
                law is one in which love, passion, and sex are removed from professional
                life, but only in the name of equality, not traditional ideas rooted in
                modesty and restraint.

                    As of the late 2010s, slightly more than one in ten heterosexual cou-
                ples met at work or through coworkers.62 According to surveys that
                asked couples about their current or most recent partner, this was down

                began to allow punitive damages for sexual harassment claims. While
                some of this change is surely due to technological developments such as

                      rC




                bility of new relationships forming. The fact that anyone still dates at
                work is a testament to human nature; individuals, particularly men, will

                before social change, with Hispanic and Asian identities largely being
                creations of a bureaucracy. In contrast, of the many developments in

                attributed to public policy. Outside of the United States, since the mid-­

                such matters for themselves.

                by a class that denies it is doing any such thing.
                    The law creates the concept of “minorities” and draws lines within

                At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, never before had an
                ideological debate been settled with such finality. For half a century, in-

                intellectually by at least the 1970s, few analysts foresaw that the Soviet
                Union would decide to abolish itself because its leaders no longer be-
                lieved in the ideology of the empire. Even those who benefited by ruling

                over a planned economy were now admitting that it could not work. It
                was almost as if, in the midst of the European wars of religion, the pope
                    rC




                announced that he’d had a revelation in which God told him that Martin
                Luther’s critique of the Catholic Church was on point. Today the debate
        pe




                is between those who advocate for a form of free market capitalism with
                relatively little redistribution, as in the United States, or one with more
                redistribution, as in Scandinavian countries. China and India, the two

                    Yet while central planning in the economic realm has been completely
                discredited, in social matters it has become an accepted part of life in
                the United States. Most Americans see themselves as part of the “free
